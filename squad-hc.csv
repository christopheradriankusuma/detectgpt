"When Link enters the Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf.[h] He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will. As a wolf, Link loses the ability to use his sword, shield, or any secondary items; he instead attacks by biting, and defends primarily by dodging attacks. However, ""Wolf Link"" gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human (though riding Epona is still faster) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items, and has improved senses, including the ability to follow scent trails.[i] He also carries Midna, a small imp-like creature who gives him hints, uses an energy field to attack enemies, helps him jump long distances, and eventually allows Link to ""warp"" to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld.[j] Using Link's wolf senses, the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight, as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named Poes.[k]","When Link enters the Twilight Realm, the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf.[h] He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms through the use of the Twilight Princess's power. As a wolf, Link gains various abilities that aid him in his quest. These abilities include enhanced senses, such as heightened hearing and smell, which allow him to track scents and locate hidden items. Link can also dig holes to uncover buried objects and traverse certain areas.

When Link is in his wolf form, he can communicate with animals and spirits. This allows him to gain information and guidance from them, which proves useful in solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. Additionally, certain characters, such as Midna, a mysterious creature from the Twilight Realm, can ride on Link's back and help him throughout his journey.

However, there are limitations to Link's wolf form. He cannot use equipment or weapons, making him more vulnerable in combat compared to his Hylian form. To address this, Link must often switch between his wolf and Hylian forms to solve puzzles and defeat"
"Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made ""Marquis of Pombal"" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal’s ""enlightenment,"" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.","Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition.

Knievel took issue with a ""sexually charged video"" in which West takes on the persona of ""Evel Kanyevel"" and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the ""vulgar and offensive"" images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment.

"Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, ""the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect"". There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is appropriate for his works. Charles Rosen comments that ""most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil, Karol Mikuli, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.""","Chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, ""the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect"". There are differing opinions as to how much, and in what manner, rubato should be applied in Chopin's music. Some argue that excessive rubato can disrupt the overall structure and coherence of the music, while others believe that it is essential for capturing the emotional depth and subtleties of Chopin's compositions.

One perspective is to apply rubato sparingly, only for specific expressive moments or to highlight particular melodic lines. This approach ensures that the overall pulse and rhythmic integrity of the music remain intact.

On the other hand, proponents of a more liberal use of rubato argue that Chopin's music often demands a more flexible interpretation to"
"Bruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology. Schmithausen is a notable scholar who has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism.[page needed][note 32] According to Vetter, ""the Buddha at first sought ""the deathless"" (amata/amrta), which is concerned with the here and now. According to Vetter, only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth."" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha ""introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time."" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.","Bruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist teachings. Instead, the concept of karma is scattered throughout various discourses, with different emphasis depending on the specific teachings. This lack of a definitive and comprehensive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka suggests that early Buddhism may have focused more on the practical aspects of overcoming suffering and attaining liberation, rather than providing a detailed explanation of the workings of karma.

In the early Buddhist teachings, karma is generally described as the intentional action or volition that shapes one's future experiences. It is believed that one's actions, thoughts, and intentions have moral consequences, which can lead to either positive or negative outcomes in this life and future existences. However, the exact mechanisms of how karma operates and how it influences rebirth are"
"On July 19, 2013, West was leaving LAX as he was surrounded by dozens of paparazzi. West became increasingly agitated as a photographer, Daniel Ramos, continued to ask him why people were not allowed to speak in his presence. West then says, ""I told you don't talk to me, right? You trying to get me in trouble so I steal off on you and have to pay you like $250,000 and shit."" Then he allegedly charged the man and grabbed him and his camera. The incident captured by TMZ, took place for a few seconds before a female voice can be heard telling West to stop. West then released the man, and his camera, and drove away from the scene. Medics were later called to the scene on behalf of the photographer who was grabbed. It was reported West could be charged with felony attempted robbery behind the matter. However, the charges were reduced to misdemeanor criminal battery and attempted grand theft. In March 2014, West was sentenced to serve two years' probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction and required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to Ramos.","On July 19, 2013, West was leaving LAX as he was surrounded by dozens of paparazzi.

" United States of America: The torch relay's North American leg occurred in San Francisco, California on April 9. On the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to an unannounced route. The start was at McCovey Cove, where Norman Bellingham of the U.S. Olympic Committee gave the torch to the first torchbearer, Chinese 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Lin Li. The planned closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza was cancelled and instead, a ceremony was held at San Francisco International Airport, where the torch was to leave for Buenos Aires. The route changes allowed the run to avoid large numbers of China supporters and protesters against China. As people found out there would be no closing ceremony at Justin Herman Plaza, there were angry reactions. One demonstrator was quoted as saying that the route changes were an effort to ""thwart any organized protest that had been planned."" San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a critic of Mayor Gavin Newsom, said that it was a ""cynical plan to please the Bush State Department and the Chinese government because of the incredible influence of money."" Newsom, on the other hand, said he felt it was in ""everyone's best interest"" and that he believed people had been ""afforded the right to protest and support the torch"" despite the route changes. Peter Ueberroth, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, praised the route changes, saying, ""The city of San Francisco, from a global perspective, will be applauded."" People who saw the torch were surprised and cheered as shown from live video of CBS and NBC. The cost to the city for hosting the event was reported to be USD $726,400, nearly half of which has been recovered by private fundraising. Mayor Gavin Newsom said that ""exponential"" costs associated with mass arrests were avoided by his decision to change the route in consultation with police chief Heather Fong.","United States of America: The torch relay's North American leg occurred in San Francisco, California on April 9. On the day of the relay officials diverted the torch run to avoid protests and potential disruptions. The decision was made due to concerns about possible demonstrations against China's human rights record and its policies in Tibet and Xinjiang.

Instead of following the originally planned route along the Embarcadero waterfront, the torch relay was diverted to a shorter, more secure route that avoided areas where protests were anticipated. This alteration was intended to ensure the safety of both the torchbearers and the general public.

Despite the altered route, a small group of protesters managed to disrupt the relay near the Golden Gate Bridge. They attempted to extinguish the torch and display banners criticizing China's human rights practices. Police swiftly intervened and managed to restore order, allowing the relay to continue.

The torch relay's North American leg faced more protests and disruptions in subsequent cities, including Paris and London. These incidents highlighted the controversy surrounding China's hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics, with critics arguing that the Games should not be hosted by a country with an alleged disregard for human rights.

"At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: ""Hats off, gentlemen! A genius."" On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: ""Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ..."" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.","At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first composition to receive significant attention), declared Chopin to be a genius.

"Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons, long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques. This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.","Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and cultural anthropology in the US have been developed as distinct fields of study.

Franz Boas, often regarded as the father of modern anthropology, introduced the concept of cultural relativism, emphasizing the importance of understanding cultures on their own terms rather than through biased lenses. Bronisław Malinowski, on the other hand, is known for his groundbreaking fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands and his development of the participant observation method.

In Great Britain, social anthropology emerged as a discipline influenced by these early pioneers. Social anthropologists in Britain focused on the study of social structures, kinship systems, and political organizations within different cultures. They often conducted fieldwork in non-Western societies, seeking to understand their social dynamics and"
"There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the ""Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas""). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.","There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later developed into multiple schools and sects within Buddhism. The term Mahāyāna, which means ""Great Vehicle"" or ""Great Way,"" was initially used to contrast with the earlier Buddhist schools referred to as Hīnayāna or ""Lesser Vehicle."" It emphasized the idea of universal salvation and the aspiration to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all beings.

In its early stages, Mahāyāna was more of a movement or set of teachings that coexisted alongside other Buddhist schools. However, over time, various Mahāyāna schools emerged, each with its own distinct teachings, practices, and scriptures. These schools include the Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, Tathāgatagarbha, Pure Land, Zen (Ch'an), and others.

The development of these schools saw the refinement and expansion of Mahāyāna doctrines, such as the concept of emptiness (ś"

"Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and Countrywide Financial, as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008. Concerns that investment bank Bear Stearns would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase. The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, and AIG. On Oct. 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO found himself before Representative Henry A.

This led to financial difficulties for these companies, as they relied heavily on borrowed funds to continue operations and expand their businesses.

As the crisis intensified, the impact started to spread to other sectors and industries. Companies that had exposure to the housing market, either through direct investments or through indirect connections, also experienced significant challenges. This included companies involved in real estate development, construction materials, and home improvement products.

The crisis also had a ripple effect on the broader financial sector, which was heavily interconnected with the housing market. Banks and financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and other related assets faced tremendous losses as the value of these assets plummeted. This led to a severe strain on the banking system, as many institutions faced insolvency or had to be bailed out by governments.

The crisis further spread to other sectors of the economy as consumer spending declined due to falling home prices, dwindling home equity, and rising unemployment. This"
"Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups. Cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy, literature and the arts (how one's culture affects experience for self and group, contributing to more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history. in that it helps develop understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.","Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world and construct their lives, while social anthropology focuses on the social organization and behavior of different groups and societies.

Sociocultural anthropology combines these two approaches by examining the relationship between culture and society. It explores how cultural practices and beliefs shape social structures and how social dynamics influence the development and transmission of cultural knowledge.

Atticus's dedication to upholding the truth and fighting for justice, even when it is unpopular, serves as a powerful example for lawyers and aspiring lawyers.

Atticus's professionalism and respect for the law are also notable. He approaches his work with diligence and respects the principles of due process,"
"Beginning with the surge in coal use which accompanied the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce.

"In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.","In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the rigorous curriculum and implementing a strong emphasis on research and scholarship. Under Father Burns' leadership, Notre Dame expanded its offerings in various fields of study and recruited renowned scholars to its faculty.

One of Father Burns' notable achievements was the establishment of the Graduate School at Notre Dame in 1921. This move allowed the university to offer advanced degrees in various disciplines and attract graduate students from across the country.

Furthermore, Father Burns recognized the importance of research in fostering academic excellence. He encouraged the faculty to engage in scholarly projects, resulting in numerous publications and research advancements.

"While there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or Shramanic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts. He mentions less likely possibilities as well.

"Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.","Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics.

"To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a ""defining essence"" or a ""core identity"" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. ""Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person""). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete ""occasions of experience"" that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as ""the essence of a thing"" or ""the identity/core of a person"" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. Identities do not define people, people define identities. Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an ""enduring essence"" misses the fact that ""all things flow"", though it is often a useful way of speaking.","To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a ""defining essence"" or a ""core identity"" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person fundamentally is.

"Lee has said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author ""should write about what he knows and write truthfully"". Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent. Lee had a brother named Edwin, who—like the fictional Jem—was four years older than his sister. As in the novel, a black housekeeper came daily to care for the Lee house and family.","Lee has said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author ""should write about what he knows and write truthfully"".

"Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity. It is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance. Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy, and that there is no difference with eating the meat of different animals.","Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity. It is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed for their meat each year in these countries. However, the consumption of dog meat is a controversial issue due to concerns about animal welfare, public health risks, and potential links to the illegal dog trade.

In Korea, dog meat has traditionally been consumed as a part of certain dishes, particularly during the summer months. However, public opinion on the practice has been changing in recent years, with an increasing number of Koreans viewing dogs as companions rather than food. As a result, the demand for dog meat has been declining, and the Korean government has introduced measures to discourage the consumption of dogs, such as shutting down dog meat farms and banning the slaughter of dogs in"

"With the occupation by Napoleon, Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, Brazil. In 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, the Prince Regent João VI of Portugal transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental State, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.","With the occupation by Napoleon, Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's colony, Brazil.

Brazil was the most valuable colony of Portugal and its independence had a considerable impact on the Portuguese economy. With the loss of Brazil, Portugal lost its main source of wealth and economic power.

"Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vinters, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.","Agriculture and horticulture seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights of plants, and the use of reflective surfaces are used to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches the plants. This is important because sunlight is the primary source of energy for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their growth and development.

Timed planting cycles involve strategically planning the timing of planting crops to coincide with the period of highest solar radiation. This ensures that plants receive sufficient sunlight during their peak growth stages, leading to higher productivity.

Tailored row orientation refers to aligning the rows of crops in a specific direction to optimize sunlight exposure. Depending on the location and time of year, the rows may be oriented to maximize or minimize shading between plants, ensuring each plant receives as much sunlight as possible.

Staggered heights of plants can also be beneficial in capturing solar energy. By planting taller plants behind shorter ones, sunlight can penetrate through to the lower plants,"

"Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw where it rests at the Church of the Holy Cross. He also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, Projet de méthode, to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. ""No longer"", he replied. He died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.","Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello.

"Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: ""It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.""","Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent and rarely seen outside the confines of her home.

It also states that while the Ming abolished the policy council set up by the Mongol Yuan to manage local affairs in Tibet and the Mongol system of Imperial Tutors to govern religious affairs, the Ming adopted a policy of bestowing titles upon religious leaders who had submitted to the Ming dynasty. For example, an edict of the Hongwu Emperor in 1373 appointed the Tibetan leader Choskunskyabs as the General of the Ngari Military and Civil Wanhu Office, stating:","The official position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is that the Ming implemented a policy of managing Tibet according to conventions and customs, and that Tibet has been an integral part of China since ancient times.

George Golos refers to earlier ""nationalist"" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's Michał Kleofas Ogiński and Franciszek Lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms. Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from ""urbanised"" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.

"In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and Polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation). Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees from bachelor's, master's and PhD that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK Council for National Academic Awards. In 1992 UK Polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster) was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In Ireland the term institute of technology is the more favored synonym of a regional technical college though the latter is the legally correct term; however, Dublin Institute of Technology is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, Cork Institute of Technology and another of other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level—Level 9 of the National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ)—for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.","In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities.

In 1863 the explorer Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological Society of London. The split was largely due to a difference in approach and ideology between the two groups. Waitz, along with others such as Edward Burnett Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan, were proponents of a more evolutionary and comparative approach to anthropology. They believed in studying cultures and societies from a historical and comparative perspective, looking for patterns and stages of development.

On the other hand, Burton and Hunt, along with other members of the Anthropological Society, favored a more descriptive and empirical approach. They focused on collecting data through direct observation and study of specific populations and cultures. They believed in the importance of detailed ethnographic research and the accumulation of knowledge about specific groups"

"The Association for Asian Studies states that there is no known written evidence to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug—Gendün Drup (1391–1474) and Gendün Gyatso (1475–1571)—had any contacts with Ming China. These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular Rinpungpa princes, who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas. The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa, yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü-Tsang. The prince of Rinbung occupied Lhasa in 1498 and excluded the Gelug from attending New Years ceremonies and prayers, the most important event in the Gelug. While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others, Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies. However, it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung, and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer. When the Drikung Kagyu abbot of Drigung Monastery threatened Lhasa in 1537, Gendün Gyatso was forced to abandon the Drepung Monastery, although he eventually returned.","The Association for Asian Studies states that there is no known written evidence to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug—Gendün Drup (1391–1474) and Gendün Gyatso (1475–1571)—had any contacts with non-Tibetan Buddhist traditions during their lifetimes. However, it is known that the fifth Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), who became a prominent figure in the Gelug tradition, did have contacts with leaders of non-Tibetan Buddhist traditions. He engaged in diplomatic relations with Mongol, Chinese, and Manchu rulers, and also had encounters with Jesuit missionaries from Europe. These interactions played a significant role in shaping the political and religious landscape of Tibet during that time."

"A year before Alfonso III ""the Great"" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them. The eldest son, García, became king of León. The second son, Ordoño, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms. This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies.","A year before Alfonso III ""the Great"" of Asturias death, three of Alfonso's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate, partitioning the kingdom among them.

"Tajikistan's economy grew substantially after the war. The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6% over the period of 2000–2007 according to the World Bank data. This improved Tajikistan's position among other Central Asian countries (namely Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), which seem to have degraded economically ever since. The primary sources of income in Tajikistan are aluminium production, cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers. Cotton accounts for 60% of agricultural output, supporting 75% of the rural population, and using 45% of irrigated arable land.

"Śuddhodana was determined to see his son become a king, so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds. But at age 29, despite his father's efforts, Gautama ventured beyond the palace several times. In a series of encounters—known in Buddhist literature as the four sights—he learned of the suffering of ordinary people, encountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an ascetic holy man, apparently content and at peace with the world. These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest.","Śuddhodana was determined to see his son become a king, so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds.

"This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the Estado Novo under António de Oliveira Salazar in 1933. Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in World War II. From the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of NATO, OECD and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with Angola and Mozambique, as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a transcontinental nation and not as a colonial empire.","This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the Estado Novo under António de Oliveira Salazar in 1933.

"Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the ""pre-capitalist"" societies that were subject to evolutionary ""tribal"" stereotypes. Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system. More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.","Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of Historical Materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy in anthropology is concerned with understanding the economic systems, distribution of resources, and power dynamics within societies. It explores the intersection of politics and economics, and how these factors shape social and cultural systems.

One key concept in political economy is Historical Materialism, which is a theory that examines the relationship between economic structures and social change over time. It argues that the mode of production, or the way a society produces and distributes its resources, influences the social and political organization of that society.

Anthropologists studying political economy look beyond simple economic transactions and instead analyze how systems of production, exchange, and consumption are embedded within social, cultural, and political contexts. They examine factors such as social class, gender, kinship, and religion, and how these shape economic practices and relationships.

"The most precarious of these quake-lakes was the one located in the extremely difficult terrain at Mount Tangjia in Beichuan County, Sichuan, accessible only by foot or air; an Mi-26T heavy lift helicopter belonging to the China Flying Dragon Special Aviation Company was used to bring heavy earthmoving tractors to the affected location. This operation was coupled with the work done by PLAAF Mi-17 helicopters bringing in PLA engineering corps, explosive specialists and other personnel to join 1,200 soldiers who arrived on site by foot. Five tons of fuel to operate the machinery was airlifted to the site, where a sluice was constructed to allow the safe discharge of the bottlenecked water. Downstream, more than 200,000 people were evacuated from Mianyang by June 1 in anticipation of the dam bursting.","The most precarious of these quake-lakes was the one located in the extremely difficult terrain at Mount Tangjia in Beichuan County, Sichuan, accessible only by foot or air; an Mi-26T helicopter was used to transport supplies and relief workers to the site.

"Native Mahayana Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, parts of Russia and most of Vietnam (also commonly referred to as ""Eastern Buddhism""). The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin, but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana (also commonly referred to as ""Northern Buddhism""). There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which ""the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today."". In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism. In Japan in particular, they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: Nichiren, peculiar to Japan; Pure Land; Shingon, a form of Vajrayana; Tendai, and Zen. In Korea, nearly all Buddhists belong to the Chogye school, which is officially Son (Zen), but with substantial elements from other traditions.","Native Mahayana Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, parts of Russia and most of Vietnam (also commonly referred to as ""Eastern Buddhism"").

"Dawa Norbu argues that modern Chinese Communist historians tend to be in favor of the view that the Ming simply reappointed old Yuan dynasty officials in Tibet and perpetuated their rule of Tibet in this manner. Norbu writes that, although this would have been true for the eastern Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham's ""tribute-cum-trade"" relations with the Ming, it was untrue if applied to the western Tibetan regions of Ü-Tsang and Ngari. After the Phagmodrupa Changchub Gyaltsen, these were ruled by ""three successive nationalistic regimes,"" which Norbu writes ""Communist historians prefer to ignore.""","Dawa Norbu argues that modern Chinese Communist historians tend to be in favor of the view that the Ming simply reappointed old Yuan dynasty officials in Tibet and perpetuated their dominance, while Tibetan historians provide evidence to support the view that the Ming dynasty implemented significant reforms and changes in Tibet.

"Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: ""Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized."" In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. While Whitehead acknowledged that ""philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles,"" he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic.

"With his third album, Graduation (2007), West moved away from the sound of his previous releases and towards a more atmospheric, rock-tinged, electronic-influenced soundscape. The musical evolution arose from him listening to music genres encompassing European Britpop and Euro-disco, American alternative and indie-rock, and his native Chicago house. Towards this end, West retracted much of the live instrumentation that characterized his previous album and replaced it with heavy, gothic synthesizers, distorted synth-chords, rave stabs, house beats, electro-disco rhythms, and a wide array of modulated electronic noises and digital audio-effects.

"In China, a call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 12, accusing the company's major shareholder, the LVMH Group, of donating funds to the Dalai Lama. There were also calls to extend the boycott to include French luxury goods and cosmetic products. Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. Some burned French flags, some added Swastika (due to its conotaions with Nazism) to the French flag, and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of French consulates and embassy. Some shoppers who insisted on entering one of the Carrefour stores in Kunming were blocked by boycotters wielding large Chinese flags and hit by water bottles. Hundreds of people joined Anti-French rallies in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao, which quickly spread to other cities like Xi'an, Harbin and Jinan. Carrefour denied any support or involvement in the Tibetan issue, and had its staff in its Chinese stores wear uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese national flag and caps with Olympic insignia and as well as the words ""Beijing 2008"" to show its support for the games. The effort had to be ceased when the BOCOG deemed the use of official Olympic insignia as illegal and a violation of copyright.","In China, a call to boycott French hypermart Carrefour from May 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the Chinese over the weekend from April 26. The call to boycott Carrefour stemmed from ongoing tensions between China and France, largely fueled by criticism of the Chinese government's handling of the Tibetan independence movement and protests during the 2008 Olympic torch relay. This led to widespread anti-French sentiment among some Chinese citizens, sparking the boycott.

The text messages and online chat rooms served as a means for individuals to share their support for the boycott and rally others to participate. The messages typically contained information about Carrefour's French origins, claims of past instances where the company expressed support for Tibetan independence, and calls for Chinese people to stand up against foreign interference.

The boycott gained momentum as more people joined and shared their involvement through these digital platforms. Some Chinese netizens even created online banners and posters encouraging others to shun Carrefour.

Carrefour, being a popular hypermart chain in China, witnessed a significant impact from the boycott. There were reports of reduced foot traffic and lower sales figures in some stores. The company responded by emphasizing its commitment to China and distancing itself from any political affiliations. They also launched marketing campaigns to regain customers' trust.

Notably, the Chinese government did not publicly endorse or support the boycott, but it did tighten regulations on foreign retailers operating in China, possibly as a show of solidarity with the sentiment.

Overall, the boycott of Carrefour in China was a grassroots movement fueled by anti-French sentiment and Chinese nationalism. It"

"Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures (2,300–2,600 °C or 4,200–4,700 °F). Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods. Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the Weizmann Institute uses a 1 MW solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide (ZnO) at temperatures above 1,200 °C (2,200 °F). This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.","Hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One thermochemical process that has been extensively studied for hydrogen production is the process of water splitting using metal oxide materials. This process involves the use of metal oxides such as iron oxide or cerium oxide, which are capable of releasing oxygen when heated at high temperatures. The released oxygen can then react with steam to produce hydrogen gas.

Another thermochemical process that has garnered attention is sulfur-based cycles. These cycles involve a series of chemical reactions using sulfur compounds, such as sulfuric acid, to split water and produce hydrogen. The sulfur compounds undergo multiple reactions, including the conversion of sulfuric acid to sulfur dioxide and the subsequent reduction of sulfur dioxide to hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is then thermally decomposed to yield hydrogen.

National sovereignty: The principle of national sovereignty gives states the ultimate authority to govern within their borders, which can create reluctance among states to intervene in the affairs of other sovereign nations, even in cases of genocide. This can make it difficult for other states or international organizations to intervene and prevent or punish acts of genocide.

2. Lack of political will: There may be a lack of political will among certain countries or international bodies to take action against genocide. This can be influenced by various factors such as economic interests, political alliances, or"

"Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked among Europe's leading copper producers. The nation is also a notable producer of tin, tungsten and uranium. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium, a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's mining and metallurgy sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves—mainly in the north—after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization, low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are among the most recognised Portuguese mines that are still in operation.[citation needed]","Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked among Europe's leading copper producers.

"The third generation began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed.

"Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that ""improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form."" The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be ""merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative"". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; ""instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure."" Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.","Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that ""improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is usually the identification of a theme or musical idea that the improviser then elaborates upon."" This was true for Chopin as well. He would often start with a simple melody or harmonic progression and then develop it into a more complex and intricate piece of music.

Chopin's improvisations were not just aimless noodling, but rather carefully crafted compositions that showcased his technical skills and artistic expression. He was known to have a vast repertoire of musical ideas stored in his mind, which he could draw upon and develop on the spot.

In addition to his virtuosic improvisations, Chopin also composed many works that were clearly influenced by the improvisatory style. His nocturnes, for example,"

"To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve’s classification of CRA loans as “prime” is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal “subprime” loans.","To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA.

Analysts argue that the CRA may have played a role in encouraging lenders to make riskier loans, but it cannot be solely blamed for the subprime lending crisis. They point to the fact that many of the loans that contributed to the crisis were made by non-bank lenders, who were not subject to CRA regulations.

Furthermore, they argue that the expansion of subprime lending was driven by the search for higher profits and the demand for mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. Wall Street's appetite for mortgage-backed securities encouraged lenders"

"Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that ""a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals"". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: ""Lawyers, I suppose, were children once."" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's ""fanatical"" attempts to place her in them made her feel ""a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]"". Johnson states, ""[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.""","Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that ""a greater understanding of legal procedures and the complexities of the legal system are depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird than in many adult legal dramas."" This can be seen in various scenes throughout the novel.

One notable scene occurs when Scout, Jem, and Dill sneak into the courthouse during Tom Robinson's trial. Through the eyes of the children, the reader is exposed to the racial biases and prejudices that exist within the criminal justice system. This scene highlights the unfairness of the legal system, where Tom Robinson is clearly innocent but is still convicted due to the racial prejudices of the jury.

Another scene that alludes to legal issues is when Atticus discusses the importance of the law and the concept of equality with his children. He explains that all men are entitled to a fair trial, regardless of their race or social standing. Atticus encourages his children to have faith in the legal system, even though it may be flawed. This conversation raises questions about the true nature of justice and the role of the legal system in upholding it.

Additionally, the character of Atticus Finch himself serves as a symbol of justice and morality in the novel. Atticus is known for his unwavering belief in the law and his willingness to defend the innocent, regardless of the odds. His defense of Tom Robinson against all odds showcases the power and importance of legal representation and the determination to fight for what is right.

"Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.","Greenhouses convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses have been used for centuries, but modern greenhouses are more efficient and sophisticated.

The basic principle of a greenhouse is to trap and retain heat, creating a controlled environment for plant growth. Greenhouses are typically made of glass or plastic, which allows sunlight to enter while preventing heat from escaping. This greenhouse effect helps maintain optimal temperatures for plant growth, even in colder climates or during winter seasons.

"Prior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a ""Light World"" and a ""Dark World""; in Ocarina of Time, as well as in Oracle of Ages, Link travels between two different time periods. The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series' latest installment. It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of A Link to the Past.[m] The story of the game was created by Aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya Kyogoku. Takano created the script for the story scenes, while Kyogoku and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in-game script. Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. When he returned, he found the Twilight Princess team struggling. Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link's character unbelievable. Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS. At the same time, the Wii was under development with the code name ""Revolution"". Miyamoto thought that the Revolution's pointing device, the Wii Remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda, and suggested that Aonuma consider using it.[n]","Prior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. In A Link to the Past, Link travels between a ""Light World"" and a ""Dark World""; in Ocarina of Time, he travels between the child and adult versions of Hyrule. This theme of dual worlds adds depth and complexity to the game's story and gameplay mechanics.

The concept of two worlds in Zelda games often represents a dichotomy of good and evil or light and dark. These worlds are connected and affect each other in various ways. In A Link to the Past, the Light World is peaceful and vibrant, while the Dark World is corrupted and filled with monsters. Link's ability to freely travel between these worlds provides opportunities to solve puzzles, find secrets, and progress in the game's storyline.

Similarly, in Ocarina of Time, the Child and Adult worlds represent different time periods of Hyrule's history. Link's actions in the Child world directly impact the state of the Adult world. This time travel mechanic adds an interesting layer of gameplay as players must strategically manipulate events in the different time periods to overcome obstacles and defeat Ganondorf.

The theme of two worlds also serves as a metaphor for personal growth and self-discovery. Link, the hero of the games, often starts in a peaceful and ordinary world before being thrust into an alternate, chaotic reality. Through his journey between these worlds, Link learns about the consequences of his actions, gains new abilities, and ultimately becomes the savior of both worlds"

"Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism. Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were ""a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition"". Various social processes in the Western World as well as in the ""Third World"" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of ""specialists in 'other cultures'"" closer to their homes. There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.","Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization, poverty, and neoliberalism. Ulf Hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were ""a notoriously agoraphobic lot, anti-urban by definition"". Various social scientists argue against this claim, stating that traditional anthropology was not necessarily anti-urban but rather focused on studying small-scale, rural, and non-western societies.

"Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 –  the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.","Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into stored chemical energy. There are various solar chemical processes, including solar water splitting, solar photocatalysis, and solar thermal chemical reactions.

Solar water splitting is a process that uses solar energy to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gases. This can be achieved through photoelectrochemical cells or by using photocatalysts to facilitate the reaction. The hydrogen gas produced can then be stored and used as a clean fuel source.

Solar photocatalysis involves using semiconductor materials as photocatalysts to harness solar energy and initiate chemical reactions. These reactions can be used for various purposes such as water purification, air purification, and even the synthesis of organic compounds.

Solar thermal chemical reactions utilize concentrated solar power to provide the necessary heat for chemical reactions. This can be achieved by using mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a reactor, reaching high temperatures required for certain chemical reactions. This process can be used for"

"Process theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as ""the fellow sufferer who understands"", and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events. Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God? Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways. C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a ""process naturalism"", i.e. a process theology without God.","Process theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as ""the fellow sufferer who understands"", and as the being who experiences and feels deeply. They emphasize that God is not an unchanging and distant figure, but rather a dynamic and evolving presence in the world.

According to process theology, God is constantly engaged in a process of becoming, always growing and learning from the experiences of the world. This means that God is affected by the events and emotions of creation, including suffering and pain.

Process theologians argue that God does not cause or willfully allow suffering, but instead works alongside individuals and the world to bring about healing and transformation. They believe that God's power is"

"The two volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his ""almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy"", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, ""No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him.""","The two volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead.

"Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize. In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs. Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself. For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that ""he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror."" French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead ""the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.""","Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize. In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs. Whitehead's ideas are often seen as complex and difficult to grasp, which has limited their widespread adoption and influence. Additionally, his focus on metaphysics and abstract concepts may seem irrelevant or inaccessible to many individuals.

Moreover, Whitehead's work has often been overshadowed by other prominent philosophers and theologians of his time, such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. These figures had a more mainstream appeal and their ideas gained more recognition and influence.

However, despite these challenges, Whitehead's influence can be seen in specific fields and niche areas. In the realm of process philosophy, his ideas continue to be studied and discussed by scholars and academics. His concept of process, which emphasizes the dynamic and relational nature of reality, has resonated with those looking for a more holistic and interconnected worldview.

"Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a ""paradox of deleveraging"" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.","Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's gain may come at the expense of others.

From 2002 to 2007, the Portuguese economy was characterized by slow growth, high unemployment rates, and a high budget deficit. The country struggled to attract foreign investment, and productivity levels remained low compared to other European Union (EU) countries.

One of the main reasons for the poor performance was Portugal's heavy reliance on low-value industries such as textiles and agriculture, which faced increasing competition from emerging markets. Additionally, the country's labor market was relatively inflexible, leading to high labor costs and hindering job creation.

Furthermore, Portugal's public finances were in a precarious state, with a high budget deficit and rapidly increasing public debt. This was exacerbated by generous social welfare programs and an inefficient public sector, which drained resources from the private sector and stifled economic growth.

"Kublai Khan did not conquer the Song dynasty in South China until 1279, so Tibet was a component of the early Mongol Empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of China under the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). Van Praag writes that this conquest ""marked the end of independent China,"" which was then incorporated into the Yuan dynasty that ruled China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, parts of Siberia and Upper Burma. Morris Rossabi, a professor of Asian history at Queens College, City University of New York, writes that ""Khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate Khan of Khans of the Mongols and as the Emperor of China. Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule"", and yet ""despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan"".

"Some developing countries that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns. For example, growth forecasts in Cambodia show a fall from more than 10% in 2007 to close to zero in 2009, and Kenya may achieve only 3–4% growth in 2009, down from 7% in 2007. According to the research by the Overseas Development Institute, reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and remittances sent from migrant workers (which reached a record $251 billion in 2007, but have fallen in many countries since). This has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line, be it 300,000 in Bangladesh or 230,000 in Ghana. Especially states with a fragile political system have to fear that investors from Western states withdraw their money because of the crisis.

For example, growth forecasts in Cambodia show a fall from more than 10% in 2007 to close to 6.5% in 2020. Similarly, China's economic growth rate has been declining over the past decade, from double-digit figures to around 6%. Other examples include India, Brazil, and Turkey, which have experienced significant economic slowdowns in recent years. 

These slowdowns are often attributed to various factors, such as global economic uncertainties, trade tensions, declining commodity prices, and internal structural challenges. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on many developing countries' economies, leading to further slowdowns.

In some cases, countries have also faced issues related to high government debt, political instability, corruption, and inefficient governance, which have adversely affected their economic growth rates.

"Theravada (""Doctrine of the Elders"", or ""Ancient Doctrine"") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It is relatively conservative, and generally closest to early Buddhism. The name Theravāda comes from the ancestral Sthāvirīya, one of the early Buddhist schools, from which the Theravadins claim descent. After unsuccessfully trying to modify the Vinaya, a small group of ""elderly members"", i.e. sthaviras, broke away from the majority Mahāsāṃghika during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira sect. Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture. They also emphasized Theravada being rational and scientific.","Theravada (""Doctrine of the Elders"", or ""Ancient Doctrine"") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school.

"The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.","The Montana Territory was formed on April 26, 1864, when the U.S. passed the Organic Act. Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families began to settle in the Montana region. The early schools in Montana were often small, one-room buildings that served multiple grades. They were typically built by the local community and funded through donations or taxes.

In these early schools, teachers played a crucial role in educating children from different age groups. They taught basic subjects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. As the number of settlers increased, the demand for schools grew, and more schools were established.

In 1889, Montana became a state, and the education system continued to grow and develop. The state government played a more active role in funding and regulating schools. By the early 20th century, the Montana education system had expanded to include more schools, especially in urban areas.

However, education in Montana faced challenges, particularly in rural and remote areas. Schools in these regions often struggled to attract and retain qualified teachers due to isolation and limited resources. Students in rural areas sometimes had to travel long distances to attend school.

Over the years, efforts were made to improve education in Montana. The state implemented compulsory attendance laws, aimed to ensure that children received an education. The curriculum expanded to include subjects beyond the basics, such as science, history, and physical education.

Today, Montana has a diverse education system that caters to the needs of its population. It has public, private, and alternative schools, as well as post-secondary institutions such as colleges and universities. The state also values the education of its Native American population and has established programs and schools to preserve and promote Native American cultures.

Overall, the development of schools in Montana has been a process that started even before it became an official territory. From humble one-room buildings to a comprehensive education system, Montana has placed importance on providing education to its residents and continues to strive for quality education throughout the state."

However, it is high still high compared with what was the normal average Portuguese unemployment rate in the past.

This significant decline in unemployment demonstrates the positive effects of the country's economic recovery and structural reforms implemented following the European debt crisis.

The Portuguese government, with support from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and European Commission, implemented austerity measures and structural reforms aimed at boosting competitiveness and attracting investment. These reforms included labor market reforms, fiscal consolidation, and measures to improve the business environment. These efforts have contributed to the gradual improvement in Portugal's economy and the decrease in unemployment.

The positive trend in employment is also attributed to the growth of the export-oriented sectors, such as tourism, textiles, and services, which have benefited from increased competitiveness and a recovery in global demand. This growth has created jobs and reduced unemployment rates.

Furthermore, the government has implemented active labor market policies, including vocational training programs and initiatives to support entrepreneurship and self-employment. These policies have helped to facilitate the transition of unemployed individuals into the labor market.

Despite the improvements, challenges remain, particularly in addressing long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. As Portugal's economy continues to recover, it will be essential to ensure that the"
"According to R. J. Rummel, genocide has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This also includes non-killings that in the end eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning.","According to R. J. Rummel, genocide has 3 different meanings.

This incident marked the beginning of a pattern of public outbursts and controversies that would become synonymous with Kanye West's public image. Throughout his career, West has been known for his candid and sometimes controversial remarks during award shows, interviews, and on social media.

One of the most notable incidents occurred in 2009 during the MTV Video Music Awards. When Taylor Swift won the ""Best Female Video"" award for ""You Belong with Me,"" West stormed the stage, grabbed the microphone from Swift, and declared that Beyoncé's video for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" was one of the best videos of all time. This incident created a huge backlash and controversy, with many criticizing West for his lack of respect for Swift and her achievement.

Over the years, West has also made headlines for his comments on politics, race, and his own personal struggles. In 2016, during his Saint Pablo Tour, he went on a series of rants during his concerts"

"In 1976, Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent (Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome (Bacteriophage MS2). The next year Fred Sanger completed the first DNA-genome sequence: Phage Φ-X174, of 5386 base pairs. The first complete genome sequences among all three domains of life were released within a short period during the mid-1990s: The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae, completed by a team at The Institute for Genomic Research in 1995. A few months later, the first eukaryotic genome was completed, with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae published as the result of a European-led effort begun in the mid-1980s. The first genome sequence for an archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, was completed in 1996, again by The Institute for Genomic Research.","In 1976, Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent (Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome (Bacteriophage MS2).

"Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex ""than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation."" Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community.

In Lee's novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" she explores the intersecting dynamics of race, class, and gender, highlighting how these factors interact to shape individuals' experiences and attitudes.

Firstly, Lee portrays the characters of Tom Robinson and Mayella Ewell to expose the complexities of racial prejudice. Tom, a Black man accused of rape, is innocent but faces a biased legal system and racist attitudes that presume his guilt solely based on his race. By contrast, Mayella, a poor White woman, is pitied by some members of the community as a victim of her abusive father.

When asked about his musical inspirations, he has named A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna as early interests. He has further described musician David Bowie as one of his ""most important inspirations,"" and named producer Puff Daddy as the ""most important cultural figure in my life."" Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed ""chipmunk soul"" which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was ""This Can't Be Life"", a track from Jay-Z’s The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has named Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard as inspirations. RZA spoke positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for Rolling Stone, ""All good. I got super respect for Kanye [...] [he] is going to inspire people to be like him."" West further developed his style on his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout. After a rough version was leaked, he meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming.","West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts, and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres throughout his work. When asked about his musical evolution, West has often cited his desire to constantly challenge himself and push the boundaries of what is expected in popular music. This has led him to experiment with genres such as hip-hop, R&B, pop, soul, electronic, and even gospel.

From his early albums like ""The College Dropout"" and ""Late Registration,"" which showcased his skill as a rapper and producer, to his more experimental and avant-garde projects like ""Yeezus"" and ""The Life of Pablo,"" West has consistently pushed the envelope and ventured into uncharted territory.

One of the defining characteristics of West's musical evolution is his ability to incorporate a wide range of influences into his music. For example, on his fourth studio album, ""808s & Heartbreak,"" he explored a minimalist and synth-driven sound heavily influenced by the likes of Phil Collins and 80s synth-pop. This departure from his earlier sound shocked some fans and critics at the time, but ultimately contributed to the evolution and diversity of his discography.

Another notable shift in West's musical approach came with the release of his album ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,"" which is considered by many as one of his best works. This album saw West combining elements of different genres and collaborating with a diverse array of artists, resulting in a bold and ambitious project that pushed"

"A cover story in BusinessWeek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania's online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis. Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. For example, an article in the New York Times informs that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions. According to The Guardian, Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him ""Dr. Doom"".","A cover story in BusinessWeek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the top business schools in the world, is known for its expertise in economics and finance. Therefore, it is important to understand their perspective on this matter.

According to a study conducted by Wharton economists, it is true that most economists failed to predict the severity and magnitude of the 2008 global financial crisis. The study highlights several reasons for this failure:

1. Incomplete models: Many economic models used by economists did not adequately capture the complex interconnections and feedback loops that existed in the global financial system. These models often assumed market efficiency and neglected the possibility of widespread systemic risks.

2. Limited data availability: The availability of relevant"
"Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).","Chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish composer John Field, to a deeper level of sophistication.

His impromptus, on the other hand, are more free-form and improvisatory, showcasing his ability to create beautiful melodies and intricate harmonies on the spot. Both the ballades and impromptus exemplify Chopin's unique musical style, characterized by his expressive use of rubato, delicate ornamentation, and"
"As white settlers began populating Montana from the 1850s through the 1870s, disputes with Native Americans ensued, primarily over land ownership and control. In 1855, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens negotiated the Hellgate treaty between the United States Government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for the tribal nations. The treaty was ratified in 1859. While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reservation, trouble with interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was opened to settlement, but the tribal nations disputed those provisions. The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.","As white settlers began populating Montana from the 1850s through the 1870s, disputes with Native Americans ensued, primarily over land ownership and control.

"Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit, in devanagari: बॊधि) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants. Bodhi literally means ""awakening"", but it is more commonly translated into English as ""enlightenment"". In Early Buddhism, bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana, using only some different metaphors to describe the experience, which implies the extinction of raga (greed, craving),[web 12] dosa (hate, aversion)[web 13] and moha (delusion).[web 14] In the later school of Mahayana Buddhism, the status of nirvana was downgraded in some scriptures, coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate, implying that delusion was still present in one who attained nirvana, and that one needed to attain bodhi to eradicate delusion:","Bodhi (Pāli and Sanskrit, in devanagari: बॊधि) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants.

"In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as ""quality"", ""matter"", and ""form"" are problematic. These ""classical"" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks. What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events. After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a ""society"" of events. By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the ""fallacy of misplaced concreteness"").","In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as ""quality"", ""matter"", and ""form"" are problematic. These ""classical"" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of reality. According to Whitehead, these concepts are static and abstract, unable to capture the dynamic and process-oriented nature of the world. 

Whitehead's alternative approach is to embrace a more relational and process-oriented ontology. He argues that reality is constantly undergoing change and is inseparable from the activities and experiences within it. Instead of treating quality, matter, and form as separate and static entities, Whitehead sees them as continually emerging and evolving through relational processes.

For example, rather than viewing quality as an inherent property of an object, Whitehead sees it as a dynamic expression of the relationships between various entities. Similarly, matter is not seen as a fixed substance but as a process"
"An article in Science suggested that the construction and filling of the Zipingpu Dam may have triggered the earthquake. The chief engineer of the Sichuan Geology and Mineral Bureau said that the sudden shift of a huge quantity of water into the region could have relaxed the tension between the two sides of the fault, allowing them to move apart, and could have increased the direct pressure on it, causing a violent rupture. The effect was ""25 times more"" than a year's worth of natural stress from tectonic movement. The government had disregarded warnings about so many large-scale dam projects in a seismically active area.

Laird asserts that the ruling Mongol khans never administered Tibet as part of China and instead ruled them as separate territories, comparing the Mongols with the British who colonized India and New Zealand, yet stating this does not make India part of New Zealand as a consequence. Of later Mongol and Tibetan accounts interpreting the Mongol conquest of Tibet, Laird asserts that ""they, like all non-Chinese historical narratives, never portray the Mongol subjugation of Tibet as a Chinese one.""","Journalist and author Thomas Laird, in his book The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, writes that Wang and Nyima present the government viewpoint of the People's Republic of China (PRC).

According to Laird, Wang and Nyima argue that Tibet was a backwards and feudal society under the Dalai Lamas' rule, and the PRC's liberation of Tibet in 1959 brought progress and equality. They contend that the PRC has implemented policies that have improved the lives of Tibetans, such as infrastructure development, healthcare, and education.

"However, while Whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual. In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of ""the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals."" In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community. Whitehead writes further that each entity ""can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe. Religion is world-loyalty. The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself."" In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.","However, while Whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual. In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary, Whitehead believed that religion is not limited to individual experiences but is also a social and communal phenomenon.

According to Whitehead's process metaphysics, reality is characterized by a constant process of becoming and change. He argued that this process is driven by relationships and interconnections between entities. In this framework, individual experiences are seen as interconnected and influenced by the wider network of relationships that constitute reality.

Religion, for Whitehead, arises from these interconnected relationships and is rooted in the collective experiences of a community. He suggested that religion provides a framework for understanding and responding to the multiplicity and interconnectedness of existence"

"Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.","Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time. The contemporary focus of environmental anthropology is on understanding the impact of human activities on the environment, as well as how cultural practices and belief systems shape human-environment interactions.

Environmental anthropologists study a wide range of topics including traditional ecological knowledge, resource management, environmental justice, climate change, sustainable development, and the cultural dimensions of environmental issues. They use various research methods such as participant observation, interviews, surveys, and document analysis to collect data and analyze human-environment relationships.

One key concept in environmental anthropology is the idea of cultural ecology, which emphasizes the dynamic interplay between culture and the environment. Cultural ecologists argue that human societies adapt to and modify their environments based on their cultural beliefs,"

The actress Maria Nafpliotou, in the role of a High Priestess, used a concave mirror to focus the rays of the sun and ignite the Olympic Torch. This flame was then carried by a series of torchbearers on an international relay that would eventually reach its destination, the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China.

The lighting of the Olympic Flame at Olympia is a symbolic tradition that dates back to ancient Greece. In ancient times, the flame was believed to be a sacred symbol of purity and the connection between humans and the gods. Lighting the flame at Olympia was seen as a way to honor the ancient Olympic Games and invoke the blessings of the gods for a successful and peaceful competition.

The use of a concave mirror to ignite the torch is a modern adaptation of this ancient tradition. The mirror focuses the sun's rays into a single point, creating enough heat to spark a fire. This method was first introduced in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and has been used ever since.

"In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, ""What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?"" However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, ""My tragedy"". Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.","In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

Despite their contrasting personalities, Chopin and Sand quickly formed a deep and passionate connection.

Sand was highly intrigued by Chopin's musical talent and became one of his strongest supporters and advocates. The couple embarked on a tumultuous affair that lasted for almost a decade. They travelled together extensively, indulging in bohemian lifestyles and immersing themselves in art and culture.

Chopin was drawn to Sand's free-spirited nature and found solace and inspiration in her presence.

"The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, as shown in audio tests. The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.","The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, as shown in audio tests. The combination of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a poor pairing that resulted in a weak bass response.

"Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of ""Five"", which means ""Failed"". Gesamtschule senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of their class and had an average grade of ""Three Plus"". When a central Abitur examination was established in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, it was revealed that Gesamtschule students did worse than could be predicted by their grades or class rank. Barbara Sommer (Christian Democratic Union), Education Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, commented that: Looking at the performance gap between comprehensives and the Gymnasium [at the Abitur central examination] [...] it is difficult to understand why the Social Democratic Party of Germany wants to do away with the Gymnasium. [...] The comprehensives do not help students achieve [...] I am sick and tired of the comprehensive schools blaming their problems on the social class origins of their students. What kind of attitude is this to blame their own students? She also called the Abitur awarded by the Gymnasium the true Abitur and the Abitur awarded by the Gesamtschule ""Abitur light"". As a reaction, Sigrid Beer (Alliance '90/The Greens) stated that comprehensives were structurally discriminated against by the government, which favoured the Gymnasiums. She also said that many of the students awarded the Abitur by the comprehensives came from ""underprivileged groups"" and sneering at their performance was a ""piece of impudence"".","Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their class and yet still received high grades. This has raised concerns about the accuracy and fairness of grading systems in comprehensive schools.

The study, which involved comparing the performance and grades of students across different types of schools, found that Gymnasium senior students with average mathematical ability consistently scored lower in exams compared to their peers in other schools. However, despite these lower scores, they still received relatively high grades that did not accurately reflect their actual knowledge and abilities.

This phenomenon has been attributed to grade inflation, where schools artificially inflate grades to present a positive image or maintain high pass rates. Critics argue that this practice devalues the importance of accurate assessment and undermines students' educational experience.

Grade inflation can have significant consequences for students, both in terms of their academic development and future opportunities. If students are receiving high grades without truly mastering the subject matter, it can lead to a false sense of achievement and hinder their progress in higher education or career pathways that require a strong foundation in mathematics.

Moreover, grade inflation also undermines the credibility of education systems and can negatively impact students who genuinely excel in their studies. When high grades lose their significance, it becomes increasingly difficult for universities and employers to differentiate between students based on their academic performance.

To address this issue, comprehensive schools need to re-evaluate their grading practices and ensure that grades accurately reflect students' knowledge and abilities. Implementing stricter standards for assessments, such as using external examiners or more objective measures, can help maintain the integrity and credibility of grades.

One day, the village is attacked by Bulblins, who carry off the village's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight. A Shadow Beast pulls him beyond the wall into the Realm of Twilight, where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned. Link is soon freed by an imp-like Twilight being named Midna, who dislikes Link but agrees to help him if he obeys her unconditionally. She guides him to Princess Zelda. Zelda explains that Zant, the King of the Twilight, has stolen the light from three of the four Light Spirits and conquered Hyrule. In order to save Hyrule, Link must first restore the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight-covered areas and, as a wolf, recover the Spirits' lost light. He must do this by collecting the multiple ""Tears of Light""; once all the Tears of Light are collected for one area, he restores that area's Light Spirit. As he restores them, the Light Spirits return Link to his Hylian form.","Twilight Princess takes place several centuries after Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and begins with a youth named Link who is working as a ranch hand in Ordon Village.

"In 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the Halve Maen (""Half Moon"" in Dutch) into New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for his employer, the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what he named the North River, also called the Mauritis River, and now known as the Hudson River, to the site of the present-day New York State capital of Albany in the belief that it might represent an oceanic tributary. When the river narrowed and was no longer saline, he realized it was not a maritime passage and sailed back downriver. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland).","In 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the Halve Maen (""Half Moon"" in Dutch) into New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage. Hudson was hoping to find a shorter trade route to Asia by sailing westward. Instead, he encountered the area that would later become known as New York.

After entering New York Harbor, Hudson explored the Hudson River, which was later named after him, for several days. He continued northward, reaching present-day Albany before turning back. Despite not finding the much sought-after Northwest Passage, Hudson's voyage established Dutch claims to the region.

Hudson's exploration sparked interest in the area among Dutch merchants, and in 1624, the Dutch West India Company established the colony of New Netherland. The settlement was primarily focused on trading furs with Native American tribes in the surrounding area."

In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance.

"Under Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood. A second constitutional convention was held in Helena in 1884 that produced a constitution ratified 3:1 by Montana citizens in November 1884. For political reasons, Congress did not approve Montana statehood until 1889. Congress approved Montana statehood in February 1889 and President Grover Cleveland signed an omnibus bill granting statehood to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Washington once the appropriate state constitutions were crafted. In July 1889, Montanans convened their third constitutional convention and produced a constitution acceptable by the people and the federal government. On November 8, 1889 President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed Montana the forty-first state in the union. The first state governor was Joseph K. Toole. In the 1880s, Helena (the current state capital) had more millionaires per capita than any other United States city.","Under Territorial Governor Thomas Meagher, Montanans held a constitutional convention in 1866 in a failed bid for statehood.

"Not-self (Pāli: anatta; Sanskrit: anātman) is the third mark of existence. Upon careful examination, one finds that no phenomenon is really ""I"" or ""mine""; these concepts are in fact constructed by the mind. In the Nikayas anatta is not meant as a metaphysical assertion, but as an approach for gaining release from suffering. In fact, the Buddha rejected both of the metaphysical assertions ""I have a Self"" and ""I have no Self"" as ontological views that bind one to suffering.[note 9] When asked if the self was identical with the body, the Buddha refused to answer. By analyzing the constantly changing physical and mental constituents (skandhas) of a person or object, the practitioner comes to the conclusion that neither the respective parts nor the person as a whole comprise a self.","Not-self (Pāli: anatta; Sanskrit: anātman) is the third mark of existence. Upon careful examination, one finds that no phenomenon is really ""I"" or ""mine""; these concepts are in fact constructed by the mind. This means that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul that exists independent of other phenomena.

The concept of not-self challenges the inherently egocentric nature of human beings. It suggests that our identification with a personal identity is an illusion created by our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. According to this understanding, all aspects of ourselves, including our thoughts, emotions, physical body, and even our consciousness, are impermanent and constantly changing.

"Though based upon Mahayana, Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice Vajrayana or ""Diamond Vehicle"" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism). It accepts all the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy through ritual, visualization, physical exercises, and meditation as a means of developing the mind. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In the Tibetan tradition, these practices can include sexual yoga, though only for some very advanced practitioners.","Though based upon Mahayana, Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice Vajrayana or ""Diamond Vehicle"" (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism, or esoteric Buddhism).

"Rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008. Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy, and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states. A pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified. The destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis.","Rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, while prices for other commodities such as copper, gold, and wheat also experienced significant rises during this period.

There are several factors that contributed to these rapid price increases in commodities. Firstly, the collapse of the housing bubble led to a widespread economic downturn, with many countries experiencing recessions. This resulted in decreased demand for goods and services, leading to a decrease in production. However, during this time, central banks around the world implemented expansionary monetary policies to stimulate economic growth. This influx of money into the economy led to increased liquidity and encouraged investors to seek higher returns by investing in commodities.

Secondly, there were supply-side factors that affected commodity prices. For example, the price of oil was influenced by geopolitical factors, such as tensions in the Middle East and concerns about supply disruptions. Additionally, the rapid economic growth of emerging"
"In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286 USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceed 20% and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics is over 40%.","In the last two decades, photovoltaics (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A number of factors have contributed to this evolution.

First, there has been a significant decrease in the cost of PV technology. Advances in manufacturing processes, economies of scale, and improved efficiency of solar panels have made them much more affordable and accessible. This has led to a rapid increase in the installation of PV systems globally.

Second, there has been a growing recognition of the environmental and sustainability benefits of solar PV. As concerns over climate change and air pollution have increased, there has been a greater push for renewable energy sources. Solar PV is seen as a clean, renewable source of electricity that can help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Government support and incentives have also played a crucial role in the growth of solar PV. Many countries have implemented policies such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards to encourage the adoption of solar energy. These incentives have helped create"
"Hesburgh is also credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. ""In American college education,"" explained the Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and Letters, ""certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place.... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism."" Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added that coeducation ""opened up a whole other pool of very bright students."" Two of the male residence halls were converted for the newly admitted female students that first year, while two others were converted for the next school year. In 1971 Mary Ann Proctor became the first female undergraduate; she transferred from St. Mary's College.

"A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations. It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects. Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things. The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything. But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves. A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:","A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations. It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects. Each object is simply an isolated entity to be utilized or consumed. This perspective overlooks the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things.

In reality, everything in the universe is interconnected and exists in relation to one another. Materialism fails to recognize the intricate web of relationships that form the fabric of our existence. It disregards the fact that our actions and choices have ripple effects that can impact others and the world around us.

Canis familiaris is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with Canis lupus."" In 1982, the first edition of Mammal Species of the World listed Canis familiaris under Canis lupus with the comment: ""Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, familiaris.

"Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient India during the second half of the first millennium BCE. That was a period of social and religious turmoil, as there was significant discontent with the sacrifices and rituals of Vedic Brahmanism.[note 15] It was challenged by numerous new ascetic religious and philosophical groups and teachings that broke with the Brahmanic tradition and rejected the authority of the Vedas and the Brahmans.[note 16] These groups, whose members were known as shramanas, were a continuation of a non-Vedic strand of Indian thought distinct from Indo-Aryan Brahmanism.[note 17] Scholars have reasons to believe that ideas such as samsara, karma (in the sense of the influence of morality on rebirth), and moksha originated in the shramanas, and were later adopted by Brahmin orthodoxy.[note 18][note 19][note 20][note 21][note 22][note 23]","Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient India during the second half of the first millennium BCE.

Buddhism originated with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who later became known as the Buddha. Born into a royal family in present-day Nepal around the 6th century BCE, Siddhartha led a sheltered life of luxury. However, at the age of 29, he encountered suffering and realized the impermanence of life. This revelation prompted him to renounce his privileged existence and embark on a spiritual quest to find a way to overcome human suffering.

For several years, Siddhartha practiced asceticism and meditation under different teachers but ultimately found neither approach to be satisfactory. He then decided to sit under a Bodhi tree and engage in deep meditation until he attained enlightenment. After a period of intense meditation,"

"A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA. In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later. Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis. Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.","A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) covered institutions. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the CRA on mortgage lending practices and access to credit in underserved communities.

The study found that the CRA had a positive effect on mortgage lending in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. It revealed that CRA-covered institutions were more likely to originate mortgages in areas they were required to serve under the Act. These areas were predominantly low-income and minority communities.

The $467 billion in mortgage lending made by CRA-covered institutions represented approximately 22% of all mortgage lending during the study period. This indicated that the Act played a significant role in expanding access to credit and homeownership opportunities for underprivileged communities.

Furthermore, the study found that CRA-covered institutions were more active in making loans to low-income and minority borrowers than non-covered institutions. It suggested that the Act's requirements contributed to reducing disparities in lending practices and increased access to credit for traditionally underserved populations.

Overall, the 2000 Treasury study concluded that the CRA had a positive impact on mortgage lending in underserved communities. It demonstrated that CRA-covered institutions played a crucial role in increasing access to credit for low-income and minority borrowers, ultimately helping to"

Josef Kolmaš writes that the Ming dynasty did not exercise any direct political control over Tibet, content with their tribute relations that were ""almost entirely of a religious character.""

The Ming court's relationship with the fifth Karmapa and other Tibetan leaders was a crucial aspect of the Ming Dynasty's foreign policy and diplomacy. The Ming court recognized the authority and spiritual leadership of the fifth Karmapa, who was a prominent figure in Tibetan Buddhism. This relationship allowed the Ming Dynasty to strengthen its control over Tibet and maintain stability in the region.

However, Chinese Communist historians have tended to downplay or ignore the agency and significance of non-Chinese actors and cultures in history. They often view Tibetan history primarily through the lens of Chinese imperial rule, reducing the influence of Tibetan leaders and disregarding their independent actions.

"Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison. This project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology. Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic (conceptual, vs. etic, or technical) point of view.","Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values. Accepting other cultures in their own terms allows anthropologists to gain insights into the diversity of human experience and challenge Eurocentric biases.

Cultural relativism recognizes that each culture has its own unique way of interpreting and experiencing the world. By suspending judgment and attempting to understand other societies from within their own cultural context, anthropologists aim to avoid ethnocentrism – the belief that one's own culture is superior to others. This approach fosters empathy and understanding towards cultural differences, and helps to uncover the underlying meanings and motivations behind various cultural practices.

Accepting other cultures in their own terms enables anthropologists to appreciate the complexity and richness of human diversity. By studying a"

"Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives, which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels. These instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy, and contributed to the need for government bailouts.","Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses.

After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops. When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him. The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort. After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died.","The Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505–1521), who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate, had heard tales of a ""living Buddha"" which he desired to host in his imperial palace. Determined to find this living Buddha, the Zhengde Emperor sent out a decree instructing his courtiers to search for him.

The news of the emperor's desire spread throughout the empire, and eventually reached the ears of a Tibetan monk named Dorje Shugden. Dorje Shugden, a highly respected lama known for his wisdom and spiritual powers, decided to respond to the emperor's call.

Dorje Shugden made the arduous journey from Tibet to the imperial capital of Beijing, where he was granted an audience with the Zhengde Emperor. Impressed by the lama's presence and demeanor, the emperor immediately recognized him as the living Buddha he had been seeking.

Ecstatic about his find, the Zhengde Emperor offered Dorje Shugden a place of honor within the imperial palace. He treated him with great respect and showered him with lavish gifts and accommodations. The emperor also sought the lama's guidance on various matters, consulting him on both spiritual and political affairs.

The courtiers, however, were not pleased with the emperor's decision to host a lama at court. They believed that bringing a religious figure into the imperial palace would be a breach of the Confucian values and traditions that governed the court. They lodged their protests with the censorate, arguing that the emperor"
"However, the early Ming government enacted a law, later rescinded, which forbade Han Chinese to learn the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism. There is little detailed evidence of Chinese—especially lay Chinese—studying Tibetan Buddhism until the Republican era (1912–1949). Despite these missions on behalf of the Hongwu Emperor, Morris Rossabi writes that the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) ""was the first Ming ruler actively to seek an extension of relations with Tibet.""","However, the early Ming government enacted a law, later rescinded, which forbade Han Chinese to learn the tenets of Tibetan Buddhism. There is little detailed evidence of Chinese—especially lay Chinese—studying Tibetan Buddhism during the Ming dynasty.

"Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.","Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1).

"Suffering (Pāli: दुक्ख dukkha; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha) is also a central concept in Buddhism. The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness, sorrow, affliction, anxiety, dissatisfaction, discomfort, anguish, stress, misery, and frustration. Although the term is often translated as ""suffering"", its philosophical meaning is more analogous to ""disquietude"" as in the condition of being disturbed. As such, ""suffering"" is too narrow a translation with ""negative emotional connotations""[web 9] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic, but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic.

Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.","Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, deciduous trees provide shade during the summer months, reducing the amount of solar heat that enters the building. This can help to lower cooling costs by reducing the need for air conditioning.

During the winter months, when the trees have shed their leaves, they allow more sunlight to reach the building, providing passive solar heating. This can help to reduce heating costs by allowing the building to absorb and retain more heat from the sun.

Deciduous trees and plants can also help to improve air quality and create a more comfortable outdoor environment. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and"

"Born in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott , who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.","Born in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer Truman Capote.

Again in the 1990s, after joining the European Economic Community, the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a 68,732 km (42,708 mi) road network, of which almost 3,000 km (1,864 mi) are part of system of 44 motorways. Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an innovative project that made Portugal among one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5). But, although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970), it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented. In 1972, Brisa, the highway concessionaire, was founded to handle the management of many of the regions motorways. On many highways, toll needs to be paid, see Via Verde.

During these periods of economic growth, the Portuguese government focused on improving transportation networks to support the growing economy. They invested in the construction of new roads, highways, and bridges, as well as the expansion of airports and ports.

One of the major projects during this time was the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Lisbon, which opened in 1998. This bridge, the longest in Europe at the time, helped to alleviate congestion in the city and improve transportation between the northern and southern parts of Portugal.

The government also invested in the expansion and modernization of public transportation systems, such as the metro systems in Lisbon and Porto. These improvements made it easier for people to commute within the cities and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

"In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy.

"The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, ""Through the Wire"" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. ""Slow Jamz"", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. ""Jesus Walks"", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.","The College Dropout was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the Billboard 200 as his debut single, ""Through the Wire"" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100.

"Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anti-cyclones. Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C. By photosynthesis green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.","Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, expanding and cooling as it ascends. This cooling causes the water vapor to condense into clouds, releasing heat energy. The upward movement of warm air and the subsequent condensation of water vapor create circulation patterns in the atmosphere, known as convection currents.

Additionally, solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface is absorbed by land and water, heating them up. These heated surfaces then radiate heat back into the atmosphere, warming the air near the surface. This process creates local temperature variations, which influence weather patterns and the formation of weather systems such as high and low-pressure systems.

"Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls ""applied process thought"" to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows ""a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening."" Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research (2008), and Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.","Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events on organizations and their development. Whitehead's philosophy emphasizes the importance of process and change, suggesting that every phenomenon is in a constant state of becoming. This perspective has influenced scholars and practitioners in the field of business administration and organizational theory to consider the dynamic nature of organizations, rather than viewing them as static entities.

One area where Whitehead's influence is evident is in the study of organizational change. Scholars have applied Whitehead's thinking to explore the impact of temporal events, such as crises, mergers, or technological advancements, on organizational change processes. By understanding how these temporal events shape organizations' development, researchers and managers can better navigate change and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Additionally, Whitehead's philosophy has spurred discussions on the role of time in organizations. Scholars have started to examine the temporal dimension of organizational life, studying the impact of time intervals, deadlines, and time pressure on organizational outcomes. Whitehead's emphasis on process and becoming has provided a theoretical lens to understand the temporal complexities"

Game Informer called it ""so creative that it rivals the best that Hollywood has to offer"". GamesRadar praised Twilight Princess as ""a game that deserves nothing but the absolute highest recommendation"". Cubed3 hailed Twilight Princess as ""the single greatest videogame experience"". Twilight Princess's graphics were praised for the art style and animation, although the game was designed for the GameCube, which is technically lacking compared to the next generation consoles. Both IGN and GameSpy pointed out the existence of blurry textures and low-resolution characters. Despite these complaints, Computer and Video Games felt the game's atmosphere was superior to that of any previous Zelda game, and regarded Twilight Princess's Hyrule as the best version ever created. PALGN praised the game's cinematics, noting that ""the cutscenes are the best ever in Zelda games"". Regarding the Wii version, GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann said the Wii controls felt ""tacked-on"", although 1UP.com said the remote-swinging sword attacks were ""the most impressive in the entire series"". Gaming Nexus considered Twilight Princess's soundtrack to be the best of this generation, though IGN criticized its MIDI-formatted songs for lacking ""the punch and crispness"" of their orchestrated counterparts.

Critics commended the game's darker and more mature tone, which was a departure from the cel-shaded visuals of The Wind Waker. They also praised the game's dungeons and puzzles, highlighting their complexity and creative design.

The addition of the wolf transformation mechanic was also well-received, as it brought a fresh gameplay element to the series. The game's vast overworld, known as Hyrule Field, was also praised for its size and exploration opportunities.

Moreover, reviewers praised the game's audio, noting the memorable soundtrack and excellent voice acting. The game's controls, particularly the implementation of motion controls on the Wii version, were also lauded.

Despite the high acclaim, some reviewers did have a few criticisms. They mentioned that the game's pacing could sometimes feel slow, with a lengthy introductory section. Additionally, the game's overworld was criticized for feeling empty in certain areas.

"A. Tom Grunfeld says that Tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the Ming court, while Rossabi adds that Tsongkhapa cited the ""length and arduousness of the journey"" to China as another reason not to make an appearance. This first request by the Ming was made in 1407, but the Ming court sent another embassy in 1413, this one led by the eunuch Hou Xian (候顯; fl. 1403–1427), which was again refused by Tsongkhapa. Rossabi writes that Tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the Ming court, so he sent his disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes to Nanjing in 1414 on his behalf, and upon his arrival in 1415 the Yongle Emperor bestowed upon him the title of ""State Teacher""—the same title earlier awarded the Phagmodrupa ruler of Tibet. The Xuande Emperor (r. 1425–1435) even granted this disciple Chosrje Shākya Yeshes the title of a ""King"" (王). This title does not appear to have held any practical meaning, or to have given its holder any power, at Tsongkhapa's Ganden Monastery. Wylie notes that this—like the Karma Kargyu—cannot be seen as a reappointment of Mongol Yuan offices, since the Gelug school was created after the fall of the Yuan dynasty.","A.

"The Desert Land Act of 1877 was passed to allow settlement of arid lands in the west and allotted 640 acres (2.6 km2) to settlers for a fee of $.25 per acre and a promise to irrigate the land. After three years, a fee of one dollar per acre would be paid and the land would be owned by the settler. This act brought mostly cattle and sheep ranchers into Montana, many of whom grazed their herds on the Montana prairie for three years, did little to irrigate the land and then abandoned it without paying the final fees.

"Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa, the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the Yangzi and Mekong Rivers in order to facilitate trade with Tibet in tea, horses, and salt. The trade route passed through Sichuan and crossed Shangri-La County in Yunnan. Wang and Nyima assert that this ""tribute-related trade"" of the Ming exchanging Chinese tea for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants—""furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet"". Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming. Peter C. Perdue says that Wang Anshi (1021–1086), realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds, had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea. The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons. The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement. The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets, but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions.","Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa, the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the Yangzi River. This was done with the aim of enhancing communication and trade between the Ming Dynasty and Tibet. The road, known as the Tea Horse Road or Tea-Horse Ancient Road, became a major trading route for goods such as tea, horses, and salt.

The trading posts along the road served as hubs for merchants to exchange and rest, creating a network of commercial activity. This not only facilitated economic exchange but also promoted cultural interactions between the Han Chinese and Tibetans.

The construction of the road and trading posts marked a significant shift in the relationship between the Ming Dynasty and Tibet. Prior to this, the relationship had been characterized by sporadic military campaigns and political tensions. However, the establishment of trade routes helped foster a more peaceful and mutually beneficial relationship.

In Gerês both deciduous and coniferous forests can be found, an extremely rare worldwide mature mediterranean forest remain in some parts of the Arrábida mountain and a subtropical laurissilva forest, dating back to the Tertiary period, covers its largest continuous area in the world in the Madeira main island.

"The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed ""the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro"". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it ""reasonable to believe"" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: ""To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.""","The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed ""the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro"". In the second part of the novel, the author explores the deep-rooted racism and prejudice that exists within the white Southern community towards the Black population. This serves as a criticism of the social and cultural norms prevalent during that time period.

The spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner is represented through the various characters and their interactions with African Americans. The novel highlights the pervasive discrimination, mistreatment, and dehumanization faced by Black people in the South.

The author delves into the complex dynamics of power and race, illustrating how the white population's attitudes and actions perpetuate a system of oppression and injustice. The shame, as described by LeMay, arises from a sense of complicity and guilt that arises when confronted with the harsh realities of racial prejudice.

Through the narrative, the author explores themes of guilt, redemption, and the moral responsibility individuals have to challenge and change the oppressive systems in which they exist. The characters are confronted with the consequences of their actions and are forced to confront their own prejudices"

However, many scholars and experts today believe that Chopin's cause of death was likely complications related to cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system.

Cystic fibrosis was not well understood during Chopin's time, and his symptoms, such as chronic cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing, were often"

"During the century of internecine struggles for dominance among the Northern Christians kingdoms, the County of Portugal, formed the southern portion of the Kingdom of Galicia. At times the Kingdom of Galicia existed independently for short periods, but usually formed an important part of the Kingdom of Leon. Throughout this period, the people of County of Portugal as Galicians found themselves struggling to maintain the autonomy of Galicia with its distinct language and culture (Galician-Portuguese) from the Leonese culture, whenever the status of the Kingdom of Galicia changed in relation to the Kingdom of Leon. As a result of political division, Galician-Portuguese lost its unity when the County of Portugal separated from the Kingdom of Galicia (a dependent kingdom of Leon) to establish the Kingdom of Portugal. The Galician and Portuguese versions of the language then diverged over time as they followed independent evolutionary paths. This began occurring when the Kingdom of Leon and the Kingdom of Castile united and the Castilian Language (known as Spanish) slowly over the centuries began influencing the Galician Language and then trying to replace it. The same thing happened to Astur-Leonese Language to the point where it is greatly reduced or completely replaced by the Castilian (Spanish Language).","During the century of internecine struggles for dominance among the Northern Christians kingdoms, the County of Portugal, formed the southern portion of the Kingdom of Galicia. At times the Kingdom of Galicia included Portugal, and at times Portugal was a separate county. The County of Portugal emerged as an independent entity in the 12th century. Under the leadership of Count Henry and his wife, Teresa, the county gained more autonomy and eventually became the Kingdom of Portugal in 1139.

The Kingdom of Portugal continued to assert its independence and expand its territory over the following centuries. Under the reign of Afonso Henriques, the first King of Portugal, the kingdom successfully fought against both Muslim and Christian rivals and expanded into the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Throughout its history, Portugal also engaged in maritime exploration and colonization. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese explorers like Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan played a significant role in the Age of Discovery. Portugal established colonies and trading posts in Africa, Asia, and South America, becoming a global power.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Portugal faced challenges including wars with neighboring Spain and conflicts with other European powers. However, it managed to maintain its independence"
"The root schism was between the Sthaviras and the Mahāsāṅghikas. The fortunate survival of accounts from both sides of the dispute reveals disparate traditions. The Sthavira group offers two quite distinct reasons for the schism. The Dipavamsa of the Theravāda says that the losing party in the Second Council dispute broke away in protest and formed the Mahasanghika. This contradicts the Mahasanghikas' own vinaya, which shows them as on the same, winning side. The Mahāsāṅghikas argued that the Sthaviras were trying to expand the vinaya and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for arhatship. Both parties, therefore, appealed to tradition.","The root schism was between the Sthaviras and the Mahāsāṅghikas. The fortunate survival of accounts from both sides of the dispute reveals disparate traditions. The Sthavira group offers two quite distinct accounts of the root schism. One account suggests that the schism was caused by a dispute over monastic discipline, specifically regarding the Vinaya rules. According to this account, the Mahāsāṅghikas wanted to relax certain rules, while the Sthaviras were more conservative and insisted on strict adherence to the original Vinaya. This led to a split in the monastic community, with the Sthaviras forming their own group and the Mahāsāṅghikas forming another.

The second account provided by the Sthavira group suggests that"
