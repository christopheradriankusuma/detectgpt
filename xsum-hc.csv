"The Student Representative Council (SRC) has been agitating about the statue of old colonialist Cecil John Rhodes.
It all began when student Chimane Maxwele tossed human excrement at the statue recently, demanding that it be taken down.
The statue of Rhodes is at a prominent position of the campus. It's on the upper campus, overlooking the university's rugby fields on Madiba Circle, previously known as Rugby Road. The statue depicting Rhodes in a seated position was unveiled in 1934.
Rhodes was an Oxford-educated politician and mining businessman, who played a key role in the expansion of British rule in southern Africa.
The university's campus is on a site bequeathed to the nation by Rhodes - who owned vast tracts  of land - for a national university.
SRC head Ramahiba Mahapha, 23, told me the statue was ""a symbol of institutional racism"".
Mr Mahapa, a fourth-year student of philosophy, continued ""there are more substantive issues of transformation that we are fighting for"".
""The statue is just a symbol. We need to have more black students and more black academics.
""The university is too Eurocentric. In a country where nearly 80% of the population is black, there are 1,500 academics at UCT and only 100 are black. That needs to change,"" the outspoken student leader said.
The university has said it recognises ""divergent views"" over the statue and that it is important to debate the matter.
UCT vice-chancellor Max Price told the Cape Times that talks about removing the statue from the university campus were at a ""stalemate"".
It is reported that while he was an active student in 1980s, Dr Price once called for the statue to be removed.
In an open letter this week Dr Price concluded: ""I do not think the statue should be destroyed or hidden away. I just think it should not be there - it should be moved.
""This will not compromise our ability to record and debate the role Rhodes played in the city's and continent's history.
""And it will not change our acknowledgment that UCT acquired its site from the Rhodes estate, and the positive contribution that it has made to our institution and its students.""
During demonstrations on campus, students were chanting ""Rhodes must fall"" and they carried a banner with the same message written on it.
But not everyone holds the same view.
Trudi Makhaya, who studied as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, wrote in South Africa's Business Day newspaper that Rhodes was limited by the sexism and racism of his era but his scholarship endowments revealed a man who recognised some universal virtues.
Ms Makhaya wrote: ""These contradictions, Rhodes the pillager and Rhodes the benefactor, are a symbol of our country's evolution towards a yet to be attained just and inclusive order.
I agree with both the vice-chancellor and Mr Mahapa - the statue must not be destroyed but the university can do without a symbol of racism and colonialism in a post-Nelson Mandela era.
There was no love lost between the English- and Afrikaner-speaking peoples in the era leading up to the Anglo-Boer war of 1899-1902.
Rhodes wanted the British to control the Boer republics. But even when the Afrikaners came to dominate the country, they left his statue alone.
There are many symbols of white supremacy and colonialism in modern-day South Africa such as street names, the names of towns and even monuments which still evoke deep emotions among black people.
It would be a shame if this was the start of a historical tit-for-tat.
What if in another hundred years someone calls for Mandela's statue to be removed?","The Student Representative Council (SRC) has been agitating about the statue of old colonialist Cecil John Rhodes. It all began when student Chimane Maxwele tossed human excrement at the statue of Cecil John Rhodes in protest. The SRC has been demanding the removal of the statue, arguing that it represents a painful reminder of the country's colonial past and its racist ideologies.

The incident involving Chimane Maxwele sparked a nationwide debate on the presence of colonial-era statues and symbols in public spaces. It reignited discussions about decolonization, racial inequalities, and the need to confront historical injustices. Many students and activists joined the SRC in their protests, calling for a more inclusive and representative environment on campus.

The agitation by the SRC has resulted in various actions and discussions taking place. University authorities have engaged with the SRC to address their concerns and find a way forward. This has led to a series of dialogues, debates, and public consultations to determine the fate of the statue.

While some argue that the statue should be preserved as part of history, others believe that it should be removed and placed in a museum, where its historical context and impact can be appropriately discussed. The SRC has also proposed the replacement of colonial statues with ones that pay tribute to South African heroes, particularly those who fought against colonial oppression and championed freedom and equality.

The issue has not been without controversy, as some individuals view the calls for statue removal as an erasure of history or a denial of the country's complex past. Nonetheless, the persistent agitation by the SRC has brought attention to the necessity of critically examining and reevaluating symbols and structures that perpetuate colonial legacies.

Ultimately, the decision on the statue's future rests with the university authorities, who need to consider the demands of the SRC, the opinions of various stakeholders, and the broader societal implications. The ongoing dialogue and activism surrounding the issue serve as a reminder that historical symbols can carry deep emotional significance and have the power to shape collective memory and identity."
"She and her family were told they were going to be resettled. The journey took six days and some in the truck died on the way.
""There was some straw on the floor,"" she told me. ""It was dark, it was cold, it was so hostile. And hardly any space for sitting down. There was a lot of crying, lots of children. And we were trapped. Doors were shut, we knew this was not going to be any resettlement but we had no imagination of course of what was to come.""
The doors opened at Auschwitz.
There, on the railway platform, Nazi officers separated those chosen to live and work from those sent immediately to die.
Susan lied about her age. A prisoner on the platform whispered to her that she should say she was 15. It saved her life, but her mother was sent immediately to the gas chamber.
""There were no hugs, no kisses, no embrace. My mum was just pushed away with the other women and children. The dehumanisation began immediately. I didn't cry, it was as though I'd lost all my emotions.""
Soviet forces entered Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945.
The Nazis had abandoned the camp days earlier, leaving much of it intact. More than a million people, mostly Jews - but Poles, Roma and political prisoners as well - had been murdered there.
Those railway lines - which can be still seen at Auschwitz today - extended to almost every corner of Europe.
The Holocaust was not a solely German enterprise. It required the active collaboration of Norwegian civil servants, French police, Polish train drivers and Ukrainian paramilitaries. Every occupied country in Europe had its enthusiastic participants.
MPs mark Holocaust Memorial Day
Holocaust Memorial Day: What can we learn?
Antiques Roadshow sheds new light on ring belonging to Jane Haining
iWonder: Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust?
After 1945, a great silence fell across the continent.
The Jews who survived found that the world beyond the perimeter wire of the camps did not much want to know their story.
It was only in the 1960s that popular consciousness began to catch up with the crime perpetrated against an entire people.
Holocaust denial persists. The internet is full of claims that the destruction of the Jews never happened.
""Sometimes they want to call themselves revisionist historians,"" says Pawel Sawicki, who works at the Auschwitz site, which now attracts two million visitors a year. ""But they are not. They hate others. This is anti-Semitism.""
At the Nuremberg trials after the war, leading Nazis were held accountable for the state-sponsored crimes that had been committed in Germany and German-occupied territories. For the first time, two new terms entered the grim lexicon of wartime atrocity - crimes against humanity and genocide.
This is the Nazis' judicial legacy - that from 1945, sovereign states no longer had legal carte blanche to treat their own citizens as they pleased.
""That's the amazing, revolutionary, remarkable change that happened in 1945,"" says Philippe Sands, an international human rights lawyer who has worked extensively on war crimes prosecutions.
""Before 1945, if a state wished to kill half its population, or torture or maim or disappear, there was no rule of international law that said you couldn't do that. The change that occurred in 1945 - as we know very sadly - has not prevented horrors from taking place.
""But it does mean that when horrors occur, there is now at least an objective standard that says to governments, to individual states, that as a matter of international law: 'you cannot do what you are doing'.""
Near the blockhouses where Auschwitz prisoners were housed, there is a large open trench about the size and shape of a swimming pool.
During the war it was filled with water. Why? It was required by the camp's fire insurance policy.
There is something grotesquely chilling about this - that a camp whose purpose was mass extermination would, at the same time, concern itself with sensible precaution and compliance with insurance law. And the company that insured the camp is still trading. There is a warning in this to posterity - to us, here today.
As the UK marks Holocaust Memorial Day, Mrs Pollack issues a stark warning about the importance of learning the lessons from history.
""We're not talking about barbarians,"" says Mrs Pollack. ""We're not talking about primitive society.
""The Germans were well-advanced, educated, progressive. Maybe civilization is just veneer-thin. We all need to be very careful about any hate-propaganda.
""This is very important. It starts as a small stream, but then it has the potential to erupt  - and when it does, it's too late to stop it.""","She and her family were told they were going to be resettled. The journey took six days and some in the truck died on the way. ""There was some straw on the floor of the truck, but it offered little comfort. They huddled together, trying to stay warm as the vehicle rattled and bumped along the rough road. The days blurred into one another, filled with hunger, exhaustion, and a constant fear of the unknown.

As they traveled, their surroundings changed drastically. The familiar landscapes gave way to unfamiliar terrain, and with each passing mile, they felt farther from home. The journey was not only physically grueling, but emotionally draining as well. The uncertainty of their final destination weighed heavily on their hearts, overshadowing any glimmer of hope that dared to emerge.

Tragically, not everyone in the truck survived the arduous trip. Illness, fatigue, and despair took their toll on some, leaving a somber reminder of the dangers they faced. Their loss served as a haunting testament to the risks they were willing to take for the chance at a better life.

Eventually, after six long days, the truck finally came to a halt. They were met by unfamiliar faces, aid workers who greeted them with weary smiles and kind words. The family stepped out of the truck, their legs weak and bodies trembling, grateful to have reached their destination.

As they settled into their new surroundings, they were met with a mixture of relief and trepidation. The reality of starting over in an unknown place weighed heavily on their minds, but they clung to the hope that their new beginning would bring stability and opportunity.

In the following weeks, they navigated the resettlement process, finding support and resources that eased their transition. Slowly but surely, they began to forge a new life, rebuilding what was lost and embracing the future with newfound determination.

While the scars of their journey remained, they refused to let their past define them. The strength and resilience they displayed amidst adversity became the foundation on which they built their new life. And as time passed, their experiences served as a constant reminder of the lengths they were willing to go to seek a better future for themselves and their family."

The World Club Challenge would give the best of Super League the chance to beat the reigning NRL champions on an annual basis.
And for a while each year the cocksure Australian pundits would lose a little volume when it came to trashing the Poms and our ""inferior game"".
Of course, they always spluttered out their excuses: ""Mate, it's not fair our teams have to do all the travelling...""; ""Aw look, the weather up there gives you a massive advantage...""; ""You know, our clubs don't even take it seriously..."".
Still, it was nice to get one over on them. When rugby league worlds collide on the Test match stage, British wins are too rare. So when the club game gave us succour, we were all too eager to gloat.
But that annual pleasure has been taken away. The NRL clubs have started winning. They have been overcoming indifference, jet lag and chilblains for some time now.
Leeds were the last British winners against Manly. But that was in 2012, and it is the only British win in the last eight years.
Wigan tried to reverse the trend by reversing the travel patterns when they flew to Sydney for their World Club Challenge fixture against the Roosters in 2014, but that did not end well. The Roosters won 36-14.
British clubs still lead the head-to-head 22-match series, dating back to Wigan's 8-2 win over Manly in 1987, by 12 wins to 10.
But that statistic underlines how dominant the Super League sides were, compared with the slide in fortunes in the past decade or so.
The truth of it is that in the past three years, it has not even been close.
They have even started adding other teams to the mix to make it a World Club Series weekend - this year Warrington take on Brisbane Broncos on Saturday before Super League champions Wigan face Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks on Sunday. But the Aussies even win the warm-up games, mostly at a canter.
The NRL is getting stronger and stronger. The investment into clubs of millions of dollars on the back of a mega-bucks TV deal has seen their competition become more intense on a weekly basis.
They have even started taking England's best players, with the bulk of the national team playing in the NRL.
In each of the past few years English hopes have been artificially raised, there has been a buzz of anticipation - and then those hopes are cruelly swatted away.
Some Australian player lifts a trophy; some Australian coach tells an after-match news conference it was a good run-out ahead of the really important stuff - the NRL season; and the English rugby league fraternity are left sulking in a corner moaning about salary caps.
So, at the risk of seeing the well of eternal optimism run dry, I reckon this could be Super League's year. And how we, and the world of rugby league, need it to be.
Wigan are a terrific team and are, if anything, an even better side than they were when they won the Grand Final in October.
Their coach Shaun Wane knows exactly what this match means to the Wigan and British public. He was man of the match in that game against Manly back in 1987, when Central Park almost burst because of the number of fans inside.
Cronulla's Grand Final win last year was nothing short of a fairytale, ending a 49-year wait to lift the trophy. ""Forever ends"" was the catchline when they beat Melbourne in a nerve-shredding game.
But they will be without a clutch of their Grand Final stars, and a wintry Wigan afternoon may be the perfect platform for a Super League side to finally end the drought.
They have also spent time sightseeing in Paris during the build-up, which may suggest an eye off the ball and over-confidence - the last Australian club to take in the French capital before a meeting with a British side was the ill-fated Perth Western Reds, who followed up their trip to the Louvre with defeat by Sheffield Eagles in the extended 1997 World Club tournament.
There are even a few learned Australians who would not mind seeing Cronulla come a cropper.
Not only would a Wigan win be a major shot in the arm for Super League, it would also help revive interest in a game that should be rugby league's international best-seller.
Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan told the BBC earlier this week that he can foresee the World Club Challenge becoming rugby league's equivalent of the Champions League final - a glorious annual event that showcases the international club game at its glamorous best.
He believes the NRL will give serious consideration to how to move the World Club Challenge forward when they start considering next year how to shape the club game from 2019 onwards.
With a World Cup in the United States planned to take place in 2025, and with the growing interest in Canadian side Toronto Wolfpack, North America would make an ideal location to see the best of both hemispheres face off in a brave new world.
Others have suggested various venues in the Middle East and East Asia; from Dubai to Hong Kong. And it is easy to get excited about that prospect.
But the truth is no Australian administrator will go anywhere near that notion if Super League remains sub-standard. A win this weekend for an English side will at least plant a seed of hope.
So Wigan, it is over to you. Even St Helens fans may punch the air - when no-one is looking of course - if the Warriors were to win. Super League could puff out its chest again and claim its best is good enough.
And someone, somewhere may take note of such a result and begin the planning to make the World Club Challenge the showpiece it should be, all things being equal.","Media playback is not supported on this device The World Club Challenge would give the best of Super League the chance to beat the reigning NRL champions on an annual basis. The idea of the World Club Challenge originated in 1976, with the aim of pitting the best club teams from both the European Super League and the Australian National Rugby League (NRL) against each other. This annual event would determine the ultimate world champion of rugby league.

The concept of the World Club Challenge gained significant traction in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with increased interest from fans and sponsors. The format of the competition varied over the years, with some seasons featuring a single match, while others had a series format. The matches were played in either Europe or Australia, alternating between the host continents.

The World Club Challenge has seen some thrilling encounters and has showcased the best players from both leagues. It provides an opportunity for the Super League champions to test their skills against the leading NRL team, creating a clash between two different styles of rugby league.

Notable past winners of the World Club Challenge include iconic teams such as the Wigan Warriors, Leeds Rhinos, and Brisbane Broncos. These teams have added prestigious titles to their trophy cabinets, earning recognition as the best club teams in the world for that particular season.

The World Club Challenge not only promotes international competition but also facilitates the exchange of ideas and strategies between the Super League and the NRL. It serves as a platform for clubs to learn from each other and adapt their game plans accordingly, which ultimately improves the overall standard of rugby league across the globe.

While the World Club Challenge has faced some criticisms, including concerns about the scheduling and timing of the matches, it remains a highly anticipated event among rugby league fans worldwide. The opportunity to witness the clash of the titans, where the best of Super League take on the reigning NRL champions, provides a thrilling spectacle for fans and players alike.

In conclusion, the World Club Challenge offers the best of Super League and the NRL an annual opportunity to compete for the prestigious title of world club champions in rugby league. It showcases the highest level of the sport and continues to captivate audiences with its exciting matchups and international flavor."
"The 29-year-old produced her three best performances since the Olympics at the weekend's Anniversary Games in London.
Ennis-Hill and coach Toni Minichiello are set to make a decision by Monday, with the British team named on 28 July.
""He's kind of been up and down,"" said Ennis-Hill. ""It's going to be an interesting conversation.""
Ennis-Hill, who only returned to competition in May following the birth of her son Reggie, impressed in the 100m hurdles on Friday before setting season's bests in the long jump and 200m on Saturday.
""I am making progress and my times are coming down. I'm really happy with this weekend,"" she added.
""The training I've done over the past few weeks has made a big difference.""
But the Sheffield athlete said she would only compete in China if she felt she could challenge for a medal, with defending her Olympic title in Rio next summer the key target.
""This weekend has given me a good indication of where my speed is, but I've got to make sure that my other events are going well.
""I'm towards the end of my career. I've had an amazing career already and achieved so much. Rio is the main thing for me and I want that to go the right way.
""The World Championships this year was always going to be a massive bonus.""
Katarina Johnson-Thompson, one of Ennis-Hill's main rivals, was down on her best in the long jump on Saturday, but said she had been hampered by a quad problem for the past three weeks.
The Liverpool athlete said: ""Considering the preparation I've had for it I'm over the moon.
""I was worried about it before this competition but now I'm completely fine,"" the 22-year-old said.
This was the first time Ennis-Hill and Johnson-Thompson had gone head to head since the former's return to the sport, and her younger rival urged her to go to Beijing.
""I said to her she has to do it now considering what she did yesterday and today in the long jump, so I'm sure she'll be there,"" said Johnson-Thompson.","The 29-year-old produced her three best performances since the Olympics at the weekend's Anniversary Games in London.

"In her first broadcast interview, Alison Johnson told BBC Newsnight that the party had acted insensitively and offered no support to them since the death of their son, Elliott, in September last year.
""They are probably thinking that... we will go away quietly. But we won't. I want justice for my son,"" she said.
The Conservative Party said: ""We would like to again express our very deepest sympathies to Elliott's family and friends.""
BBC Newsnight has also learned that 15 key witnesses have called for the removal of a senior Conservative official from any involvement with the party's inquiry into the scandal.
A number of them told Newsnight they would be reluctant to talk to the investigation while the official, who has previously been associated with the former activist at the heart of the scandal, is involved in the handling of the inquiry in any way.
Mrs Johnson's son committed suicide last year after allegedly being bullied by Mark Clarke - the man who ran a road-trip campaign bussing Conservative supporters to marginal constituencies before last year's General Election.
The death of the 21-year-old led to claims the Conservative Party Headquarters (CCHQ) had ignored complaints and warnings about the conduct of Clarke and others.
This prompted the resignation from the government of Grant Shapps, who had been co-chair of the party, and the launch of an inquiry by the London law firm, Clifford Chance.
Mrs Johnson told the BBC she and her husband Ray had been frozen out by the Conservative Party.
""The Conservative Party have not been forthright in coming to speak to us in any way. Anything we've heard we've had to hear through the press. When they engaged Clifford Chance to do the investigation we heard through the press.""
She said that they had been particularly offended when it appeared the inquiry wanted to speak to her and her husband separately. She said it left them feeling like suspects whose accounts were being tested.
""We also heard that they wanted to interview me and my husband individually, to find out what our stories are... But it is not a story. It is the facts. We can only deal with the facts. Elliott has now gone, we can only deal with the facts.""
A spokesman for Clifford Chance said: ""We are sorry to learn of the Johnsons' concerns about the proposed interview format and would welcome the opportunity to discuss alternative arrangements for them to be interviewed.""
Mrs Johnson also said it felt like the Conservative Party was keeping them in the dark.
""We live in a backwater so they are probably thinking that if we silence them we will go away quietly, but we won't. We definitely won't. I want justice for my son... no matter how it comes out, I want justice.""
Mrs Johnson said Christmas had been awful without her son. An empty chair had been left at the table, she said.
""Every day just drifts into another and you just don't know anything.""
Victims 'lose faith' in Tory bully probe
Tory PR made bully complaint in 2008
Activist says Tory chairman given bullying dossier in 2010
Memo warned Tory bully 'dangerous'
Tory 'bully' was backed by party bosses
Tories 'failed to act' on 'institutionalised bullying'
Mrs Johnson spoke as a BBC Newsnight investigation revealed that 15 key witnesses who have potentially valuable testimony about bullying have called for a senior Tory official to step down from the inquiry process.
Though Clifford Chance has been commissioned to conduct the investigation, the firm's final report will be reviewed by group of senior Tories who will decide how the findings are presented.
One of those assessing the conclusions is Rob Semple, chair of the Tory volunteers' organisation, the National Convention. Mr Semple's candidacy for this post was supported by Mark Clarke.
Last year's election was marred by smearing of Mr Semple's rival for the post, Charles Heslop.
Mr Semple told Newsnight he condemned ""any alleged negative remarks about another member of the Party that might have been made, without my knowledge, during the National Convention campaign"".
However, many potential witnesses to the bullying inquiry believe Mr Semple's presence on the board in untenable - and believe he should step aside from any role in the inquiry.
Ten of the 15 key witnesses told Newsnight that Rob Semple's continued presence on the Board would deter them from giving evidence.
Ben Harris-Quinney, chair of the Bow Group, has been invited to give evidence. He has yet to decide whether he will.
""If Rob Semple doesn't stand down it says that the Conservative Party is not interested in doing the right thing and ensuring this doesn't happen again. They are merely interested in trying to cling on and get away with it and hope that the story goes away as quickly as possible,"" he said.
John Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, told Newsnight that if Mr Semple refuses to recuse himself, CCHQ should order him to do stand down.
""There is no reason whatsoever in my view why anybody who was involved with Mark Clarke should be participating and it would be a bad thing for justice if that happened.""
Mr Stafford said the bullying crisis currently engulfing CCHQ was the worst he had experienced in his 40 years as a member the party.
""This is the biggest of all. This is the absolute biggest of all. The party can no longer treat its members with contempt as it has in the past and which it is still doing.""
In a statement to Newsnight, Mr Semple said he would not stand down - and denied he was still in touch with Mark Clarke.
""I am committed to ensuring that the highest possible standards of behaviour are upheld. I will ensureâ€¦ Clifford Chance's findings will be honoured in full. I urge witnesses to come forward so that the full facts are known.""
A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Rob Semple is not being asked to step down from the Board when the report is delivered.""
Mark Clarke has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

You can follow Newsnight on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube","In her first broadcast interview, Alison Johnson told BBC Newsnight that the party had acted insensitively and offered no support to them since the death of their son, Elliott, in a racially motivated attack. Johnson and her husband accused the party of not taking the incident seriously and failing to address the systemic issues of racism within their ranks.

During the interview, Johnson emotionally detailed the pain and anguish they had experienced in the aftermath of their son's death. She explained how they had reached out to the party for support and expected them to condemn the attack and offer consolation. However, Johnson alleged that the party had largely ignored their pleas, failing to take any meaningful action.

Furthermore, Johnson criticized the party's response, stating that they had only offered ""lip service"" without taking any substantive steps towards combating racism. She expressed her disappointment with the lack of empathy and understanding demonstrated by party representatives.

Johnson's interview shed light on the struggles faced by families who have lost loved ones to racially motivated violence, emphasizing the need for organizations to support and effectively address such incidents. Her story served as a wake-up call for the party, pushing them to reflect on their actions and take concrete measures to combat racism within their ranks.

This interview marked a turning point for Johnson and her husband, who decided to leave the party in search of a more supportive and inclusive political home. Their courageous decision highlighted the importance of holding organizations accountable for their actions, especially in matters as sensitive and critical as combating racism and protecting victims.

Overall, Alison Johnson's first broadcast interview was a powerful testament to the pain and frustration experienced by victims of racially motivated attacks. Her words served as a call to action, urging organizations to prioritize the well-being of their members and confront racism head-on."

"Labour MPs voted against Mr Corbyn by 172 to 40 in the motion, after a series of shadow cabinet resignations.
Ms Dugdale said that ""if I lost the confidence of 80% of my parliamentary colleagues, I could not do my job"".
Mr Corbyn said he would not ""betray"" the members who voted for him by resigning as leader.
More than 20 members of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet and a similar number of junior ministers have quit, including sole Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray.
Lourd Foulkes, chairman of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, said no Scottish politicians would fill the shadow Scottish secretary position vacated by Mr Murray while Mr Corbyn is leader.
The former Scottish Office minister said Mr Corbyn would struggle to find ""decent people"" to fill shadow cabinet posts.
Ms Dugdale said that she had an ""excellent"" relationship with Mr Corbyn, and said she had spoken with him on the phone on Monday evening.
However, she noted that she had been elected to her position with a similar mandate, and underlined that she could not do her job if she ""lost the confidence of 80% of my parliamentary colleagues"".
The Scottish Labour leader said it was ""difficult"" for Mr Corbyn to now continue in his job.
The no-confidence vote held by Labour on Tuesday is not binding.
Lord Foulkes, who chairs the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party at Westminster, claimed that far-left and new members would soon constitute the front bench under Mr Corbyn's leadership.
He also suggested that Labour could lose its last seat north of the border if Mr Corbyn remained in his post.
Mr Corbyn faced calls to resign at a meeting in the House of Commons on Monday after more than 20 members of his shadow cabinet and a similar number of junior ministers walked out, questioning his performance during the EU referendum and ability to lead the party.
Labour's only MP in Scotland, Mr Murray, resigned from his position as shadow Scottish Secretary on Sunday.
He confirmed during a live interview on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme that he had written to his leader informing him he was stepping down.
Mr Murray said matters had been brought to a head by the result of the EU referendum.

Mr Corbyn stated that he would not resign and called for the party to come together and focus on holding the Conservative government accountable.

The motion of no confidence followed a turbulent period for the Labour Party, with many MPs expressing concerns regarding Mr Corbyn's leadership and his ability to lead a strong opposition.

There were also criticisms of the party's performance during the EU referendum campaign, where some Labour voters felt that the party did not do enough to support the Remain campaign.

He added: ""But clearly my interest is in getting the best value for the residents out of the building.""","Bridgford Hall, in West Bridgford, has been offered as a 125 year lease by its owners Rushcliffe Borough Council.

The council believes that the lease offer presents an opportunity to rejuvenate the building and enhance the local community.

"An arbitration hearing in London upheld the International Tennis Federation's principle players should no longer be able to play for more than one country.
Bedene became a British citizen in March 2015, but represented Slovenia in three Davis Cup ties before the switch.
The ITF rule was introduced with barely three months' notice on 1 January 2015.
That was after Bedene had lodged his passport application.
Charles Hollander QC concluded the ITF was not obliged to grant Bedene an exemption, but expressed the ""greatest sympathy"" for his predicament.
""The ITF change in rules has come at precisely the wrong time for him,"" Hollander states in his ruling.
""Bedene cannot be characterised as one of those players who desire to adopt a 'flag of convenience'. To make matters worse, the Slovenian Tennis Association have not taken kindly to his defection.""
The 27-year-old has fallen to 104 in the world rankings and revealed at the Australian Open that he came close to quitting the sport last year.
The ITF's board of directors rejected Bedene's appeal against the ruling last March but agreed to take the matter to arbitration after some intense diplomacy by the Lawn Tennis Association.
Bedene must now decide whether he wants to continue his challenge to the rule.
He has been given plenty of encouragement by Hollander, who says he hopes ""the passage of time will be sufficient to persuade the ITF that Mr Bedene is a worthy candidate for an exemption"".
The ITF has said it sees ""no reason in principle why a further application should not be made"".","An arbitration hearing in London upheld the International Tennis Federation's principle players should no longer be able to play for more than one country. Bedene became a British citizen in 2015, but continued to represent Slovenia in international competitions. The ITF argued that this rule was necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the sport.

The hearing resolved that Bedene should no longer be eligible to play for Slovenia and must exclusively represent Great Britain in future tournaments. This decision caused some controversy, as Bedene had expressed his desire to continue playing for both countries.

However, the ruling emphasized that players should only be allowed to represent the nation they have the strongest connection to, both culturally and competitively. Bedene's British citizenship and his decision to permanently reside in the country were considered as factors pointing towards his stronger ties with Great Britain.

Despite the disappointment of being unable to play for Slovenia, Bedene accepted the arbitration's decision and began competing exclusively for Great Britain. He expressed gratitude for the opportunities British tennis had provided him and hoped to make valuable contributions to the country's tennis success.

This arbitration hearing in London set a precedent for other players who may have dual citizenship and wish to represent multiple countries. It established that players must choose one country to exclusively represent, promoting fair competition and ensuring a level playing field for all participants in international tennis tournaments."
"Left-wing incumbent Rafael Correa is standing down after leading the South American nation for a decade.
Mr Moreno has 38% of the vote with conservative Guillermo Lasso on 30%, based on 60% of returns.
To avoid March's run-off, a candidate needs 40% and a 10 percentage point difference with the nearest rival.
Mr Moreno, a key figure in Mr Correa's cabinet between 2007 and 2013, had been predicted to win the vote.
Mr Moreno has declared himself the winner without waiting for the official results.
""This revolution nobody can stop,"" he was quoted as saying by Associated Press.
Meanwhile, Mr Lasso's supporters gathered outside the National Electoral Council, saying the run-off was unavoidable.
Centre-right Mr Lasso is a former banker who wants to create a million jobs.
Among his pledges is one to withdraw asylum rights from Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012.
Mr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998 and has most recently served as UN special envoy on disability and accessibility, has tried to distance himself from Mr Correa in recent years.
Mr Correa, who was elected in 2007 and is unable to stand again, oversaw an economic boom during his 10 years in power.
But a slump in the price of oil meant the oil-exporting country was unable to continue supporting its poverty reduction programmes, and was criticised for not putting money aside for hard times.
Recent corruption scandals have also cast the ruling party in a more negative light, and some have speculated that Ecuador will follow Peru and Argentina in electing a conservative government.
Voting is mandatory in Ecuador, and 12 million people are expected to have cast their ballot.
For the first time, transgender people were able to vote according to their chosen sex, rather than that with which they were born. Men and women vote in separate lines in Ecuador and there were reports of harassment in previous elections.","Left-wing incumbent Rafael Correa is standing down after leading the South American nation for a decade. Mr Moreno has 38% of the vote with conservative Guillermo Lasso on 30%, based on the quick count by the National Electoral Council. Both candidates are promising to address the country's economic challenges, which have been exacerbated by low oil prices and a strong US dollar. However, their proposed approaches differ significantly.

Lenín Moreno, the candidate representing the governing Alianza PAIS party, has vowed to continue Correa's policies of social welfare programs and state intervention in the economy. He has promised to increase public spending on education and healthcare and support small businesses. Moreno has also pledged to tackle corruption and promote greater dialogue and inclusivity in the political system.

On the other hand, Guillermo Lasso, the candidate from the conservative Creando Oportunidades party, is advocating for market-friendly reforms and reducing the state's role in the economy. Lasso believes in attracting foreign investment, reducing public debt, and promoting free trade. His campaign has focused on the need for fiscal austerity and deregulation to revive the economy and create jobs.

The election comes at a critical time for Ecuador, as it grapples with mounting debt, a rising unemployment rate, and a shrinking economy. Low oil prices, the country's main export, have hit its revenue hard, leading to a budget deficit and limited resources for social programs. Decisions made by the next president will be crucial in determining Ecuador's economic future.

The election has drawn international attention, with some fearing a left-wing victory could lead to increased government intervention in the economy and a continuation of the policies criticized by conservatives. Others, however, believe that continuity with Correa's policies could provide stability and protect vulnerable groups.

While the quick count results give Moreno a lead, a runoff election may be necessary if no candidate secures over 40% of the vote or a 10-point lead over the second-place candidate. The final results and the ultimate path for Ecuador's future will be determined in the coming days."

"US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire.
The move is part of a programme to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe. The USAF lease the RAF bases.
Mr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force.
""I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.""
The USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.
RAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.
The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.
Matthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.
Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move ""will come as a shock to many"", he said.
""I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community.
""We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.""
A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review.""
RAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.
It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.
Both bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.
James Waters, leader of the council, said: ""The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome.
""But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close.
""Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment.""
For some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.
In part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.
RAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.
Currently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.
The latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the ""kryptonite"" of modern air power.
They enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.
It is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.
British defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.
Indeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.
Over recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.
The US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.
Today about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.
But the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.
RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.
The USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.
Jason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was ""hugely disappointing"" as both bases contributed about £40m a year to the local economy.
He said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: ""The impact on the local economy could be considerable.
""However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years.""","US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire. The move is part of a programme to consolidate and streamline US military bases in Europe. Hagel stated that the decision to close these bases was based on an assessment of the current security environment, budget constraints, and the need to maximize operational efficiency.

The closure of RAF Mildenhall, which currently houses the US Air Force's 100th Air Refueling Wing, will result in the relocation of its personnel and equipment to Germany. RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth, which currently host US intelligence and surveillance operations, will also be closed, with some operations being consolidated at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.

The decision to close these bases has raised concerns among local communities and officials, who fear the economic impact of losing the American military presence. The bases have long been an integral part of the local economy, providing jobs and contributing to the local economy through spending by American service members and their families.

However, US officials have assured that the closure of these bases will be conducted in a responsible manner and measures will be taken to mitigate the economic impact. They have also emphasized that the decision to close these bases does not signify a reduced commitment to European security, as the US will continue to maintain a significant military presence in the region.

The consolidation of US military bases in Europe is part of a broader effort by the US Department of Defense to optimize resources, reduce infrastructure costs, and adapt to evolving security challenges. It reflects the changing strategic priorities and budgetary realities faced by the US military and its commitment to ensuring the most effective use of taxpayer dollars."
"Carla Whitlock was sprayed with drain cleaner containing sulphuric acid in Southampton on 18 September.
Billy Midmore, 23, who was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, was jailed for 15 years with a further five years on licence.
Geoffrey Midmore, 27, had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge and was jailed for nine years.
Southampton Crown Court heard the acid was thrown in the 37-year-old's face after a drug deal went wrong.
Sentencing the pair, Judge Peter Ralls QC said: ""Your behaviour displays a level of medieval barbarism that is appalling.
""You used a weapon that was pernicious and evil. You planned for this, which adds to the culpability.""
Billy Midmore, who denied any involvement in the attack, admitted sending Ms Whitlock threatening texts after his brother was robbed of drugs and cash worth Â£2,000.
Brothers jailed for Southampton acid attack - as it happened
Prosecutors said he held the mother-of-six responsible after she helped broker the deal between the brothers and a Southampton drug dealer.
Train CCTV showed him giving a high-five and fist-bumping a friend hours after the attack.
The brothers, from London, were arrested in Gillingham, Kent, on 29 September, following a two-week nationwide manhunt.
During his trial, Billy Midmore admitted coming to Southampton from London to sell crack cocaine and heroin.
The court also heard Geoffrey Midmore had sent a photograph of the drain cleaner on WhatsApp to an acquaintance, with the words: ""This is one face melter.""
The court heard Ms Whitlock needed surgery after the attack and remained in ""significant pain"".
A consultant said her right eye was prone to ""breakdown and infection"" and her eyesight was unlikely to return.
The judge told the brothers: ""You bought the drain cleaner because you intended to pour it in her face.
""To describe it as the 'face melter' could only have one interpretation.""
After sentencing, Ch Insp Debra Masson, of Hampshire Constabulary, described the brothers as ""men of violence"" who ""made people's lives a misery"".
""The evidence shown in court of their behaviour directly after the attack, coupled with their concerted efforts to evade capture, served to expose them as the dangerous criminals they are,"" she said.
""Although things will never be the same for Carla, we hope that the sentence handed to Geoffrey and Billy Midmore today goes some way to giving her closure and allows her to feel that justice has been delivered.""","Carla Whitlock was sprayed with drain cleaner containing sulphuric acid in Southampton on 18 September. Billy Midmore, 23, who was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 9 years and 171 days. Whitlock suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the attack, with severe burns to her face, neck, and chest. The incident occurred outside a fried chicken shop, and it was believed to be a case of mistaken identity. Midmore targeted Whitlock thinking she was someone else due to an ongoing dispute between their respective friends. The attack drew widespread attention and raised concerns about the availability and potential misuse of harmful substances."
"He is expected to tell MPs on Wednesday that the threshold at which the tax is levied will rise for couples from £650,000 after April 2017.
Writing in The Times, PM David Cameron and Mr Osborne said those who worked for their homes should be able to pass them on to family members.
The move fulfils a key pledge made in the Conservatives' election manifesto.
Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne also unveiled housing measures to help people buy and build their own home.
The inheritance tax policy will be funded by limiting the amount of tax relief on pension contributions given to those earning more than £150,000 a year.
In a joint article, Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne write: ""As we promised in our manifesto, we'll take the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the richest.""
They add: ""It can only be right that when you've worked hard to own your own home, it will go to your family and not the taxman.""
The Taxpayers' Alliance (TPA) - a right-leaning pressure group - said it ""broadly welcomed"" the end of inheritance tax, but said flaws in the proposals meant there could be ""perverse incentives"" for older people to sell all of their assets to buy a bigger home and pass it on tax-free when they died.
Andy Silvester, campaigns director at the TPA, said: ""Inheritance tax is one of those things, that even for people who frankly would not be hit by it at the moment, is a really unpopular tax.
""People find it fundamentally unfair that income you've already been taxed on in order to buy your house is taxed on when you die.
""In parts of the country the really wealthy are not necessarily living in £1m houses.""
But Mr Silvester said there was a danger the policy could increase house prices and said ""radical planning liberalisation"" was needed to build more homes and prevent house prices from rising.
Mr Osborne has been keen on the idea for nearly a decade, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said.
Before the election, the chancellor told the BBC the plan ""supports the basic human instinct to provide for your children"".
At present, inheritance tax is payable at 40% on the value of an estate in excess of the tax-free allowance of £325,000 per person. Married couples and civil partners can pass the allowance on to each other.
From April 2017 parents will each be offered a further £175,000 ""family home allowance"" to enable them to pass property on to children tax-free after their death.
This will be added to the existing £325,000 inheritance tax threshold, bringing the total transferable tax-free allowance from both parents in a married couple or civil partnership to £1m.
Since the election, it is reported the plan has been tweaked so that where couples have ""downsized"" to a smaller property after their children have left home, the allowance will still apply to the old family home.
Critics are expected to argue the plan will benefit the wealthiest in society. Last year, the estates of 35,000 were subject to inheritance tax; around 5% of the total.
Before the general election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said of the Tory plan: ""This (and in fact any) IHT cut will also go disproportionately to those towards the top of the income distribution"".
In April Labour's Chris Leslie, currently the party's shadow chancellor, said the policy was a ""panicky promise"" from the Conservatives.
He said at the time: ""The Tories made a promise on inheritance tax before the last election and they broke it.
""At a time when our NHS is in crisis and most working people are paying more under the Tories, it cannot be a priority to spend £1bn on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90% of estates.""","He is expected to tell MPs on Wednesday that the threshold at which the tax is levied will rise for couples from £650,000 after April 2017.

"Graham McKinlay repeatedly stabbed Thomas Brennan, 28, in Union Street, Glasgow, in June last year.
The 32-year-old also slashed two other men in separate attacks in Glasgow in December 2014.
McKinlay was given a lifelong restriction order and must serve five years before he can apply for parole.
Unemployed McKinlay, of no fixed abode, had earlier admitted attempting to murder Mr Brennan by repeatedly striking him with a knife to his severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of his life.
He had also pled guilty to two further knife attacks committed within a day of each other which left victims wounded.
Sentencing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Boyd of Duncansby said McKinlay's criminal record included many offences of violence.
He described the assault on Mr Brennan as an ""an unprovoked attack"" on a young man, out with his fiancÃ©e enjoying a good time, who was now reliant on pain killers and suffered nightmares.
Lord Boyd said: ""The best word to describe what you did to him is your own - that is 'despicable'.""
The murder bid victim was wearing a potato sack over his head with eye holes cut in it and a rope around his neck as part of a scarecrow costume.
As McKinlay approached, he grabbed the rope and pulled on it which shifted the sack so that Mr Brennan could not see.
McKinlay then punched him on the head but the victim managed to break free and ran into the road and pulled off the sack.
McKinlay pursued him and punched him again before putting him a headlock and began stabbing him.
Others became involved in the disturbance and witnesses called the emergency services.
One of McKinlay's earlier knife attacks was racially aggravated. He assaulted Safdar Ali, then 29, at St Enoch's Square, in Glasgow, in December 2014.
The victim sustained a mouth wound which needed eight stitches.
The following day McKinlay attacked a bus passenger in the city's Dumbarton Road.
He struck Richard McCluskey, then 32, with a craft knife, which left him bleeding from his ear and left side of his face.
Defence counsel Niall McCluskey told the court that McKinlay did feel remorse for his crimes.

"May suffered a knee injury while playing for Gloucester in last month's Premiership draw with Harlequins.
The 25-year-old England's first-choice left wing at the World Cup and has won 19 international caps so far, but will now miss the Six Nations.
""Following an operation on his left knee on Tuesday, Jonny May will be ruled out of the remainder of the campaign,"" said a club statement.
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys described the injury as ""significant"" but refused to disclose exact details of what May had suffered.
""He had surgery on Tuesday, the operation went well,"" Humphreys told BBC Radio Gloucestershire. ""It's very difficult to put a timeline on any knee injury. It's a disappointing end to the 12 months for Jonny, both at club and international level.""
May's absence is a further blow for new England head coach Eddie Jones, with Bath forward Dave Attwood and Leicester lock Ed Slater ruled out of next month's championship earlier this week.
Northampton prop Kieran Brookes is also set for an extended spell on the sidelines after having an operation on his knee, as is Exeter centre Henry Slade and back row Dave Ewers.
England start their Six Nations campaign under Jones against Scotland on 6 February.
Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell featured in the World Cup and may be the likely starters at Murrayfield, while Chris Ashton and Semesa Rokoduguni are pushing for places in the squad.
Humphreys hopes to have May back for the start of next season, with the winger likely to also miss England's summer tour of Australia.
""He was very quick to text me after the operation to tell me he plans to come back fitter and stronger,"" added Humphreys.
""Jonny has shown in the past when he has been injured that he will work hard and I have no doubt we will see him back performing and shining in Gloucester colours.""","May suffered a knee injury while playing for Gloucester in last month's Premiership draw with Harlequins. The 25-year-old England's first-choice left wing at the World Cup and has won 19 caps for his country. The injury occurred when May was tackled awkwardly and his knee twisted. He immediately fell to the ground in pain and had to be helped off the field.

Since the injury, May has undergone several tests and scans to determine the extent of the damage. It has been confirmed that he has suffered a torn ligament in his knee, which will require surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation period.

The news comes as a blow to both May and his club Gloucester, as he has been a key player for both teams. May's speed and agility on the wing have made him a dangerous threat in attack, and his absence will be sorely felt.

Gloucester will now have to find a replacement for May in their lineup, as they continue their push for a playoff spot in the Premiership. The loss of such a talented player will undoubtedly be a challenge for the team.

For May, the injury is a setback in his career, especially considering his successful World Cup campaign and his growing reputation as one of England's top players. However, he remains determined to come back stronger and return to the field as soon as possible.

Rehabilitation for a torn ligament typically takes several months, and May will have to work diligently to regain his fitness and strength. The injury also puts his availability for future international matches in doubt, as he may miss important tournaments and qualifiers.

Despite the setback, May is grateful for the support he has received from his fans, teammates, and coaches. He is focused on his recovery and looks forward to returning to the sport he loves.

In the meantime, May will be cheering on his teammates from the sidelines and offering his support wherever he can. He is confident that Gloucester will continue to perform well in his absence and is"
"Lifeguards discovered broken bottles, the remains of barbecue and damage to Whiterocks unit's radio aerial on Wednesday morning.
A large rock which had been thrown at the hut left a two inch hole in the unit which had also been covered with indecent graffiti.
The RNLI estimated that repairs will cost £800.
The vandalism follows two of the busiest days on Northern Ireland's beaches this summer.
RNLI Lifeguard Supervisor Karl O'Neill said the damage to the aerial mount had threatened vital VHF communications while the rock damage meant the unit was no longer watertight.
He said: ""Our lifeguards rely on the aerial to communicate with each other when on patrol and to communicate with their colleagues in the Coastguard in the event of an emergency.
""Thankfully the damage has not rendered our communications off-service but should it have and should it have happened during the last two days which brought thousands of people to our beaches to enjoy the good weather, lives could have been put at risk.

However, Will Bragg's unbeaten innings of 119 completely turned the game in favor of Glamorgan. He formed century partnerships with Mark Wallace (40) and Chris Cooke (59) to guide Glamorgan to victory."
"Botanic Primary introduced a range of measures to improve its attendance rate, which was one of the worst in Belfast.
In 2009, the attendance rate at the 220 pupil school was under 85%.
This meant pupils on average missed school for one and a half out of every 10 days.
By 2015, their attendance rate had risen nearly 10% to 94%.
That means that, on average, pupils were at school for an extra day every two weeks.
Botanic's pupils come from a diverse range of backgrounds, with 28 nationalities, while Roma pupils make up almost a fifth of the student population.
The principal, Paul Bell, and staff introduced a number of measures to get pupils to school more.
The school contacts parents straight away if they have concerns about attendance, and raises the topic at every parents' meeting.
They outline to parents how many days of school their child has missed on a regular basis.
The school also introduced rewards for good attendance.
These included a free school trip for children who attended school on at least 95% of days over the course of a term.
The trips, to locations like the cinema or adventure centres, cost the school about Â£500 each.
However, they have been very successful.
Fewer than one-third of the pupils were eligible for the first trip, but that has now risen to almost two-thirds of children.
Senior teacher Carol Thompson, who organises the activities, said: ""At the beginning we only needed one bus, because maybe two to three years ago we only had about 50 children coming.""
""This has been such a success that in January we will be taking 63% of the school.""
Mr Bell said that they had to get the message across to children, as well as parents, that absence hampered learning.
""If parents aren't really taking attendance seriously, to go and talk to them has limited effect,"" he said.
""When you talk to the children and start to impress upon the children that they are missing out on their education it's much more meaningful.""
""When the children start to see the value of school then they start to come.""
""And when you make the school a fun and attractive environment, who wouldn't want to come here?""
The Education Training Inspectorate (ETI) praised the school for an attendance ""strategy combining extrinsic awards, information to parents and prompt action when attendance drops to 90%.""
The Education Minister Peter Weir has also launched a new strategy called ""Miss School = Miss Out"" to improve pupil attendance.","Botanic Primary introduced a range of measures to improve its attendance rate, which was one of the worst in Belfast. In 2009, the attendance rate at the 220 pupil school was just 78%. The school recognized that improving attendance was crucial for the overall educational attainment and well-being of its students. Therefore, Botanic Primary implemented various initiatives to address this issue.

One of the strategies implemented by the school was to raise awareness about the importance of regular attendance among parents, students, and staff. They conducted information sessions, workshops, and parent meetings to emphasize the correlation between attendance and academic success. The school also provided resources and materials to assist parents in understanding and addressing attendance barriers.

To tackle specific reasons for non-attendance, Botanic Primary sought to identify and address underlying issues. They dedicated staff members to work closely with families struggling with attendance problems. These staff members collaborated with the families to identify any challenges they faced, such as lack of transportation, health issues, or language barriers, and endeavored to provide appropriate support and solutions.

The school also implemented reward systems to motivate and recognize students with excellent attendance. They introduced monthly and yearly attendance awards, certificates, and celebrations to encourage students to attend school regularly. Additionally, they liaised with external organizations to offer incentives such as tickets to local attractions or events to students with excellent attendance records.

Furthermore, Botanic Primary aimed to ensure a positive and engaging learning environment to make students eager to attend school. They focused on improving teaching methods, enhancing the curriculum, and providing a wide range of extracurricular activities, such as sports, arts, and clubs. By creating a stimulating learning environment, they aimed to foster a sense of belonging and enthusiasm among students, contributing to higher attendance rates.

Botanic Primary also established a robust system of monitoring and tracking attendance. They regularly analyzed attendance data to identify trends, patterns, and individual cases requiring intervention. This allowed them to provide targeted support to students with persistent attendance problems and to track the effectiveness of their initiatives.

Through these measures, Botanic Primary managed to significantly improve its attendance rate over the years. By 2019, the attendance rate had risen to 92%, indicating a remarkable transformation and a positive impact on the school community. The school's efforts to address attendance issues demonstrated a commitment to ensuring that all students had equal opportunities to succeed academically and thrive in their education."

"Mehr news agency said they were involved in newsgathering, recruiting and training for Iranian journalists and had arranged trips abroad for them.
A BBC statement said no BBC Persian staff members were working inside Iran.
It said the reports ""should be of deep concern to all those who believe in a free and independent media"".
Last week, the BBC accused the Iranian authorities of a campaign of bullying and harassment against those working for its Persian service.
On Monday evening, a report by the semi-official Mehr agency cited an unnamed ""knowledgeable source"" as saying that ""a number of people deceived by the lie-spreading BBC Persian network"" had been arrested.
The source said they had ""the mission of gathering news and information, producing content in various formats, recruiting, training and preparing for the departure of Iran's elite media workers from the country"".
They had committed ""many anti-security crimes as part of their co-operation with this network"" since 2009, when mass protests erupted after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the source added.
""The case of the detained people will be handed over to the judiciary department for the issuance of a verdict after the final compilation and preparation of the charges,"" the source stated, without naming them.
""As has been previously said, any kind of co-operation with the BBC Persian channel is illegal and will be prosecuted.""
In a statement, the corporation reiterated that there were ""no BBC Persian staff members or stringers working inside Iran"".
""These latest reports appear to confirm our recent statements and should be of deep concern to all those who believe in a free and independent media,"" a spokesperson said.
""They admit that the Iranian authorities are engaged in a persistent campaign, intimidating and arresting people who they claim have connections with the BBC Persian service.""
In a blog published on Friday, the BBC's Director General Mark Thompson wrote that he had seen ""disturbing new tactics"", including the targeting of family members of Persian service staff working outside Iran.
Mr Thompson revealed that the sister of one man had been arrested the previous week and held in solitary confinement on unspecified charges at Evin Prison in the capital, Tehran.
""Although she has now been released on bail, her treatment was utterly deplorable and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.""
Mr Thompson also said some staff had had their Facebook and email accounts hacked, and been subjected to a ""consistent stream of false and slanderous accusations... ranging from allegations of serious sexual assault, drug trafficking, and criminal financial behaviour"".
In September, Iran arrested six film-makers, accusing them of working for BBC Persian. The corporation said they were independent, and that it had merely bought the rights to broadcast their documentaries.
Human Rights Watch said the harassment of BBC Persian staff was part of a wider campaign to stifle freedom of information in Iran ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for next month.
It also comes amid mounting tensions over Iran's nuclear programme.
On Tuesday, Iranian media said MPs were considering a bill to prohibit the export of oil to the European Union, which approved a ban on Iranian oil imports last month in reaction to Tehran's continued refusal to halt uranium enrichment. The EU buys about 20% of Iran's oil exports.","Mehr news agency said they were involved in newsgathering, recruiting and training for Iranian journalists and had arranged trips abroad for them. A BBC statement said no BBC Persian staff were involved in any of these activities with Mehr news agency."
"The festival is promising to maintain its balance between hands-on fun and more serious explorations of what science means to all of us.
For two weeks from 1st April its 270 events will be spread across almost 30 venues, including the now-traditional five floors of noisy and occasionally gooey fun in the City Arts Centre.
Edinburgh was the world's first science festival and is still the biggest in Europe.
Among its new exhibitions is Play On, billed as an interactive, family-friendly exhibition which lets audiences get hands-on with the ways technology influences our leisure time.
It will take place across four immersive zones in the Grand Gallery of the National Museum of Scotland, looking at visual tools from cave paintings to 3D printing, changes in games technology since the 1970s, how we have listened to and stored music down the ages, and the rise of digital toys.
Another attraction, Moments in Time, will be a free, interactive exhibition.
It will be housed in four blue police boxes on the Mound which - whisper this in case the BBC's lawyers are listening - will be bigger on the inside than they appear on the outside.
Each box will have a different theme: the Scottish Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the information age and 101 Scottish inventions.
On the list of the latter, John Logie Baird's television, Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, plus golf, whisky and Irn Bru - the last three occasionally enjoyed together.
Of course other nations may make competing claims for some of these.
The telephone is also claimed by Canada and the United States but Bell was born and educated here.
The Netherlands may have come up with the idea of chasing a wee ball with a stick - although others point to the Chinese or the ancient Romans - but it was the Scots who wrote the rules of the modern game.
Irn Bru (other spellings of startlingly bright orange soft drink are available) is definitely, uniquely Scottish.
Moments in Time is part of Scotland's Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology 2017, so historians have a whole year to argue over the rest.
Also on the list of Scotland's 101 greatest hits: Sherlock Holmes and Treasure Island, underlining that this year's EISF is offering its biggest ever arts programme.
It will include a season of theatre, exhibitions, installations and concerts examining how we conduct, use and communicate science.
And as always this experimentation, artistry and interactivity will be backed up by a slate of lectures and discussions on topics from the impact of Brexit on British science to the pursuit of scientific truth in this allegedly post-truth world.
It is a festival unabashedly pitched at every age group.
This year the organisers are especially keen to capture the hearts and minds of teenagers who may decide to choose science as a career.
The programme launch took place on the southern shore for the Forth in front of the three great bridges which now span the firth.
One of the police boxes was given its first outing for the benefit of press photographers.
The snappers, enthused by the presence of this and an array of other props, spent more than an hour inviting two members of the EISF to adopt ever more bizarre poses for the cameras involving a bicycle, golf clubs and the aforementioned orange skoosh.
This culminated when one of the half-frozen young women had to pretend to make a phone call while wearing a brightly coloured, papier mache bird's head.
The reason?  That the cover of this year's festival programme includes some of our feathered chums.
At least I'm pretty sure that was the reason.
Surely not even we Scots can claim to have invented birds.","The festival is promising to maintain its balance between hands-on fun and more serious explorations of what science means to all of us. For two weeks from 1st April its schedule will be packed with a variety of activities, including interactive exhibits, engaging discussions, thought-provoking lectures, and exciting experiments.

On one hand, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in hands-on experiments and demonstrations, allowing them to engage their senses and experience science directly. They can try their hand at chemistry experiments, build their own electrical circuits, or explore the wonders of the universe through virtual reality. These activities offer a fun and immersive way to spark curiosity and ignite a passion for science in people of all ages.

On the other hand, the festival also aims to delve deeper into the broader implications of science in society. Through panel discussions and talks, experts from various fields will explore topics such as the ethical implications of scientific advancements, the role of science in addressing global challenges, and the intersection of science and art. These discussions will encourage attendees to reflect on the impact of science in their lives and its potential for shaping the future.

Additionally, the festival will feature exhibits that showcase groundbreaking scientific research and innovations. From exhibits featuring the latest discoveries in astrophysics to displays highlighting advancements in medical technology, attendees will have the chance to witness the cutting edge of scientific exploration. This blend of entertainment and education ensures that the festival caters to a wide range of interests and encourages both scientific novices and enthusiasts to engage with the world of science.

Overall, the festival's commitment to maintaining a balance between hands-on fun and serious exploration reflects its goal of making science accessible, engaging, and relevant to all attendees. By combining interactive activities, thought-provoking discussions, and captivating exhibits, the festival aims to inspire curiosity, foster understanding, and ignite a passion for science in its visitors."
"Harris Binotti, from Dumfries, is being sought by the Buramese authorities who want to question him over the death of another British man, Gary Ferguson.
Both men had been working as teachers in Yangon.
A Home Office spokesman said it would not comment on an extradition request until an arrest was made.
In April, Interpol issued a ""red notice"" - an international alert for a wanted person - for the Scottish teacher over the murder of his colleague.
It had been reported that Mr Binotti was living in Glasgow. However, Police Scotland said its officers had ""no authority"" to arrest a suspect who is the subject of an Interpol alert.
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""As a matter of long standing policy and practice, the UK will neither confirm nor deny that an extradition request has been made or received until such time as the subject of the request is arrested in relation to the request.""
Police Scotland said there was no update in the force's position on the case.
A spokeswoman added:""The Myanmar authorities have the lead in the investigation into the death of Peter Gary Ferguson.
""Police Scotland has no authority to arrest anyone at this stage. Police Scotland will continually monitor any ongoing risk and take all appropriate measures""
Mr Binotti reportedly took a flight from Myanmar to Thailand before Mr Ferguson's body was found in his flat in November last year.
Mr Ferguson and the 26-year-old accused are believed to have gone out drinking two nights before his body was discovered and neighbours reported hearing sounds of a fight.
Both men taught English at the Horizon International School in Yangon, in the south of the country formerly known as Burma.
Mr Ferguson, who had a four-year-old son, had worked there for a year while Mr Binotti had been there for three months.","Harris Binotti, from Dumfries, is being sought by the Buramese authorities who want to question him over the death of another British man, Gary Ferguson. Both men had been working as teachers at the same international school in Yangon, Myanmar. The authorities believe that Binotti is a key witness in their investigation.

The incident involving Ferguson's death occurred in November 2016, when both men were reportedly involved in a fight at a local bar. Ferguson sustained fatal injuries during the altercation, and Binotti left Myanmar shortly afterward.

Since then, Burmese authorities have been searching for Binotti to question him regarding the circumstances surrounding Ferguson's death. They have released an international arrest warrant through Interpol in an effort to locate and bring him back to Myanmar.

Binotti, originally from Dumfries, Scotland, is a trained musician and had been teaching at the school in Yangon for several years. He is described as being in his early thirties, with brown hair and a slim build.

The case has attracted significant attention both in the local and international media due to the involvement of two British nationals and the mysterious circumstances surrounding Ferguson's death. The British embassy in Myanmar has been providing assistance to the Burmese authorities in their search for Binotti.

Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Harris Binotti is urged to contact the local authorities or the nearest British embassy or consulate."
"Eamon Lynch had no driving licence or insurance when he crashed into Shane Patton's car in County Donegal in 2012.
Lynch was previously described as having the biggest criminal record in British and Irish judicial history.
On Thursday, a judge sentenced the father-of-three from Londonderry to 18 months in prison.
His mother, Julie Patton, read a victim impact statement to the court in which she described her son as a ""happy beautiful boy"".
Letterkenny Circuit Court heard how Lynch and his partner were driving along the main Ballbofey to Letterkenny road when the collision happened.
Just after midnight on 12 July, 18-year-old Shane Patton's car emerged from a side road and was struck by Lynch, who was travelling so fast that he could not stop.
The student from Drumkeen was taken to Letterkenny University Hospital but was later pronounced dead.
The incident was caught on the CCTV system of a local service station.
Mr Patton, who was the eldest of three children, had just completed his school exams and was to about to train as a mechanic.
Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme, his mother said the family was heartbroken.
""He was my first born. He lived life to the full. He just wanted everyone to be happy and enjoy life,"" said Mrs Patton.
""He told me his biggest fear on the roads was drunk drivers, because they have no regard for anyone else.""
She added that Mr Patton's grandmother watched him being buried on what should have been a celebration of her 70th birthday.
""Family functions are different now - we can never have a family photo again. You can smile for the camera, but Shane's missing.""
Describing the sentence as ""very lenient"", she said she hopes his death might encourage legislators in the Republic of Ireland to impose heavier sentences on drink-driving offenders.
In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Patton said:  ""I thought I would have to teach Shane about the world, but I now have to teach the world about Shane.
""I have to tell people that it is not okay to drink and drive, because it destroys families.
""There is no quick fix and no getting over it. There is no glue to fix all the broken hearts.""
Lynch fled to Northern Ireland following the tragedy.
However, last month he was extradited under a European arrest warrant to face trial for Mr Patton's death.
He pleaded guilty and a note was read in court in which Lynch said he wanted to express his deep and genuine remorse to the Patton family.
""I cannot express in words how really, really sorry I am for the loss of Shane,"" he wrote.
""I will never in my lifetime get over this. I know the heartache you are going through, but I did not set out to hurt anyone, let alone hurt Shane.""
The judge said that, although drink was a factor, the main issue in the case was Lynch's speed.
He sentenced Lynch to 18 months in prison and a further three months for drink-driving to run at the same time.","Eamon Lynch had no driving licence or insurance when he crashed into Shane Patton's car in County Donegal in 2012. Lynch was previously described as having the biggest criminal record in the county, with over 40 convictions for various offenses including burglary, theft, and assault. The crash resulted in severe injuries for Shane Patton, requiring him to be hospitalized for an extended period.

Following the accident, Lynch was charged with dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm, driving without a license, and driving without insurance. It was later revealed that Lynch had been banned from driving at the time of the crash due to previous convictions related to driving offenses.

During the trial, it was discovered that Lynch had been involved in multiple hit-and-run incidents in the past, evading capture due to his reckless driving skills. Additionally, he had been repeatedly given lenient sentences or only monetary fines for his criminal activities, which many criticized as insufficient punishment given the severity of his offenses.

Given his extensive criminal record and the magnitude of the harm caused in this particular incident, public outrage grew over the leniency of the justice system towards Lynch. The case highlighted the need for stricter penalties and enforcement of driving-related offenses, as well as broader concerns about the effectiveness of rehabilitation and deterrence in dealing with repeat offenders with extensive criminal backgrounds.

Ultimately, Lynch was found guilty of dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm and driving without a license or insurance. He received a significant prison sentence, reflecting the gravity of the offense and his previous criminal record. The case brought attention to the necessity of addressing the issue of repeat offenders and the inadequacies in the justice system's handling of such individuals."
"Benjamin Herman, of Hook, Hampshire, is charged with three counts of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in the early 1970s, when he was serving as equerry to Prince Philip.
The 79-year-old is also charged with one count of indecency with a child.
Mr Herman pleaded not guilty to the charges at Kingston Crown Court.
The count of indecency with a child relates to a claim he incited the same girl to commit an act of gross indecency between January 1972 and January 1974.
The assaults are alleged to have happened at a house in south-west London used by military personnel, where Mr Herman was living at the time.
He was a serving major in the Royal Marines on secondment as equerry, handling the Duke's private matters and engagements.
He has been bailed and a trial date has been set for 18 May next year. The case is expected to last two weeks.","Benjamin Herman, of Hook, Hampshire, is charged with three counts of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in the early 1970s, when he was serving as a youth worker at a local church. The alleged assaults occurred over a period of several months, with the victim being around 10 years old at the time.

According to the prosecution, the victim, now an adult, came forward to the police in 2020 to report the incidents. She provided a detailed account of the assaults, including specific dates and locations. Additionally, she claimed that Herman had groomed her and manipulated her trust in order to commit the acts.

During the trial, the prosecution presented testimonies from the victim's friends at the time, who confirmed that she had disclosed the abuse to them around the same time it happened. They also offered descriptions of witnessing inappropriate behavior between Herman and the victim.

The defense argued that the allegations were fabricated and unsupported by any concrete evidence."
"The governing body has launched a 'Clean Athletics' brand, a year after its 14-point manifesto that aimed to create a new era of clean athletics.
The sport has been dogged by damaging headlines and reports highlighting Russian state-sponsored doping.
Warner noted a ""seismic change"" in athletics' response to doping in 2016, but said ""too much denial"" remained.
He said the ""pace of change remains too slow"".
Warner said the stances taken by athletics' governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) could be seen as a ""turning point"".
Russians have been banned by the IAAF from competing since November 2015, while the IPC banned Russia from taking part in the 2016 Rio Paralympics.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) left decisions on whether Russians could compete at the Rio Olympics to individual sporting federations.
""There is still much to do,"" Warner added.
""There remains too much denial in too many quarters, but we will continue to work to make progress in the areas we can.""
Last year, Warner said it was time for ""radical reform"".
Among UK Athletics' (UKA) proposals were plans to reset world records, introduce longer bans for drug cheats and a public register of tested athletes.
UKA highlighted steps that have since been taken:
As part of its rebrand, UKA's anti-doping department will be renamed 'Clean Athletics' and the sport's governing body suggests other anti-doping agencies should do the same to ""emphasise the ultimate purpose of their activities"".
Warner added Clean Athletics ""would urge other sports to follow suit to remain focused on what they want to achieve"".
Media playback is not supported on this device
At the time of UKA's proposals last year, authorities were already aware of alleged widespread doping in Russia with the country provisionally suspended from international competition.
Since then, in an investigation commissioned by Wada, reports from Professor Richard McLaren found more than 1,000 Russians - including Olympic medallists - benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015.
As a result, Wada recommended all Russian athletes be banned from competing from the Rio 2016 Olympics and Paralympics.
On Tuesday, leaders of 19 national anti-doping organisations said Russia should be banned from both competing in and hosting international sporting events.
The IOC has set up two commissions looking into the McLaren report findings and is awaiting the findings of these before deciding what steps it will take next.
Meanwhile, head of world athletics Lord Coe will be recalled by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee after MPs heard evidence that ""undermined"" his comments in 2015 regarding specific cases of corruption.","The governing body has launched a 'Clean Athletics' brand, a year after its 14-point manifesto that aimed to create a new era of clean athletics. The sport has been dogged by doping scandals and the lack of trust in the integrity of the athletes for many years. The launch of the 'Clean Athletics' brand is a significant step towards restoring the sport's reputation and ensuring transparency and fairness in competitions.

The brand aims to promote a culture of clean sport where athletes are encouraged to compete without the use of performance-enhancing drugs. It emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and fair competition.

As part of the 'Clean Athletics' brand, the governing body has implemented several measures to combat doping and ensure a level playing field for all athletes. These measures include stricter anti-doping regulations, increased testing, and harsher penalties for offenders.

The governing body has also partnered with various anti-doping organizations and experts to develop advanced testing methods and to stay ahead of new doping techniques. This collaboration ensures that athletes are thoroughly tested and monitored to detect any signs of doping.

Additionally, the 'Clean Athletics' brand aims to educate athletes, coaches, and support staff about the risks and consequences of doping. Education programs are conducted to instill a sense of responsibility and to create a strong anti-doping culture within the sport.

The launch of the 'Clean Athletics' brand has received positive feedback from athletes, fans, and stakeholders. It is seen as a crucial step towards rebuilding the credibility of the sport and ensuring that future generations of athletes compete in a clean and fair environment.

However, the journey towards a completely clean sport is an ongoing battle. The governing body acknowledges that there will always be individuals who try to cheat and gain an unfair advantage. Therefore, the 'Clean Athletics' brand will constantly evolve and adapt to new challenges to ensure that the sport remains free from doping.

In conclusion, the launch of the 'Clean Athletics' brand is a significant milestone in the fight against doping in sports. It represents a commitment from the governing body to restore trust and integrity in athletics by promoting a culture of clean sport. With ongoing efforts and stringent measures, the brand aims to create a new era of clean athletics."
"The 49-year-old, who was in a Range Rover, suffered head injuries in the incident near junction 6a in Hertfordshire on 16 May.
A Hertfordshire Police spokeswoman said he may have faced prosecution for not wearing a seatbelt.
She added that in relation to the incident ""no further action will be taken"".
The singer could not be reached for comment.
Michael was airlifted to a specialist trauma centre in London following the accident and spent nearly two weeks in hospital before being discharged.
Hertfordshire Police said officers were unaware of any damage to the Range Rover and confirmed no other vehicles were involved.
The former Wham! star was travelling as a rear seat passenger.
In September 2010, he received an eight-week prison sentence after crashing his Range Rover into a shop in north London.
He was also banned from driving for five years after admitting driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis.
In 2006 he was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs.
He had been found collapsed in his Mercedes.","The 49-year-old, who was in a Range Rover, suffered head injuries in the incident near junction 6a in Hertfordshire on 16 May.

"Sinn Féin repeated its call for a border poll on Monday after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she will seek a new referendum on independence for her part of the UK.
But Theresa May told MPs that Northern Ireland's political parties should focus on talks to restore Stormont.
Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party said a poll would be ""divisive"".
He argued that Sinn Féin's demand for a referendum on Irish unity ""as soon as possible"" fell outside the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill said a vote was justified because the UK's withdrawal from the EU would be ""a disaster for the people of Ireland"".
But speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mrs May said: ""What we should all be focusing on is bringing the parties together to ensure that we can continue to see the devolved administration in Northern Ireland working in the interests of the people.""
Mr Dodds said the prime minister had been clear that the ""circumstances have not been met"" for a vote on the Irish border.
""The collapse of devolution by Sinn Féin has caused enough uncertainty and division in Northern Ireland without that being further compounded through a border poll,"" he added.
Talks between the Stormont parties are continuing with a view to restoring a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive.
The negotiations are taking place after the Northern Ireland Assembly election earlier this month, which saw an end to the unionist majority at Stormont.
Sinn Féin now holds just one seat fewer than the DUP.
The parties are halfway through the three-week period they have to form a new executive.
Another election can be called if the talks fail, and ultimately power could return to the UK parliament at Westminster.
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said it was ""unfortunate"" that a round table meeting involving all the parties was cancelled at the last minute.
He said the decision had possibly been taken ""at the behest of the DUP"".
He told reporters at Stormont that it would have been the first time during the current process that all the parties had met together.","Sinn Féin repeated its call for a border poll on Monday after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she will seek a new referendum on independence for her part of the United Kingdom. Sinn Féin, an Irish republican political party, has long advocated for a united Ireland and sees the Scottish independence movement as an opportunity to push for a border poll on the reunification of Ireland. The party believes that Brexit and the potential withdrawal of Scotland from the UK could create a significant shift in the political landscape of the British Isles. Sinn Féin sees a border poll as a democratic way to allow the people of Northern Ireland to decide their own future and potentially reunite with the Republic of Ireland.

"Former Red Rose all-rounder Glen Chapple replaced Ashley Giles as head coach at Old Trafford last week.
However, the club are exploring adding options in the shortest format.
""Glen is the head coach but we may find ourselves in a position where we want to look at the possibility of an iconic player or coach for T20 cricket,"" Allott told BBC Radio Lancashire.
Australia all-rounder James Faulkner and South Africa all-rounder Ryan McLaren have already agreed deals with the club to play in this summer's T20 competition, so any major signing would have to be a coach or non-overseas player.
Former England fast bowler Allott, 60, said they may also add more experience to their squad before the County Championship campaign gets under way on 7 April.
The Division One side will be without South African batsman Alviro Petersen, who is banned for attempting to cover up match fixing, and New Zealand paceman Neil Wagner who has joined Essex.
Opener Haseeb Hameed, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler and seamer James Anderson also look set to spend time with England in the summer.
""It's pretty obvious when you look at our squad we have lost players,"" Allott added.
""It stands to reason we need some senior experience. It may well be we sign a senior player or two very shortly.""
Allott also added they could appoint a director of cricket to work alongside Chapple in the future.","Former Red Rose all-rounder Glen Chapple replaced Ashley Giles as head coach at Old Trafford last week. However, the club are exploring adding options in the shortest format. ""Glen is a fantastic coach and has done a great job so far,"" said Old Trafford CEO, Daniel Gidney. ""But we are also aware of the growing importance of T20 cricket and we want to have the best options available to us in that format as well. We are currently exploring different options to add to our coaching staff, particularly someone with experience and success in T20 cricket.""

While Glen Chapple has primarily been known for his exploits in longer formats of the game, Old Trafford is aiming to strengthen their T20 coaching staff to improve their performances in the shortest format. T20 cricket has gained immense popularity in recent years, with leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) attracting top players from around the world.

""We want to ensure that we have a well-rounded coaching team that can deliver success in all formats of the game,"" Gidney added. ""T20 cricket requires different strategies and skills, and we want to have specialists who can guide our players and help them excel in that format.""

Old Trafford has been successful in first-class and county cricket under the guidance of Glen Chapple, but they have struggled to replicate that success in T20 competitions. By adding a T20 specialist coach to their staff, they hope to bridge that gap and compete at a high level"
"Labour’s former climate change secretary Ed Miliband said ""climate sceptics"" might try to derail the deal if they gained positions of power following the EU referendum.
Government sources told BBC News that the Brexit vote would not alter ministers' plans on the agreement.
But the sources did not offer any firm timetable for its ratification either.
A deal to attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C was agreed in Paris at the end of last year after two weeks of intense negotiations.
About 175 countries have signed up to the deal to cut carbon emissions. But each of those nations has to go a step further by formally ""joining"" or ratifying the deal in the form of a communication to the UN.
Paris climate deal: In summary
Already some analysts are warning that Brexit will spell the end of French government support for the Hinkley nuclear station.
But most of the key decisions affecting the UK will be taken by the next prime minister and the people chosen to run the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
Of the front-runners for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson has given contradictory messages on climate change over the years. He promised to make London a low-carbon energy leader, but has also cast doubt on climate science.
Michael Gove previously spoke in favour of tackling climate change, but then tried to trim the school curriculum by dropping mandatory climate change lessons - a plan that was beaten down.
Theresa May doesn’t appear to have spoken publicly on the climate.
Among other possible leadership candidates, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd and Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom both supported increased ambition for the UK on climate change whilst imposing huge cuts on renewables subsidies.
Stephen Crabb has called climate change the greatest challenge of this and future generations.
Jeremy Hunt says Conservative promises on climate change are sincere, and has generally voted with the government on climate change.
Mr Miliband told me: ""I take David Cameron at his word that he cared about these issues - but we don’t know who’s going to succeed him.
“He should ratify the agreement before he leaves office because we don't want to end up with a climate change denier or sceptic as prime minister who tries to renegotiate the whole thing.
“It’s the biggest single issue facing our world; the biggest single issue facing my kids as to whether we step up on this. We have a massive, massive challenge and we’ve got to get on with it.
“The French have ratified [the Paris agreement] and as I understand it’s perfectly in our gift to get it done. There is a majority in the House of Commons for it – so we should get on and do it.""
Only a handful of MPs voted against the Climate Change Act in 2008, and most Conservative MPs broadly support decarbonisation. But there are known ties between Euro-scepticism and climate scepticism.
Lord Lawson, who founded the climate sceptic pressure group Global Warming Policy Forum, was involved in the Leave campaign. Several Euro-sceptic and climate sceptic groups are housed in the same Westminster property, 55 Tufton Street.
And the overlapping groups say both climate change policies and the EU interfere with markets and restrict choice.
The Leave campaign complained that EU renewables targets have pushed up the cost of energy and warned that the UK’s energy security will be reduced if coal plants are shut.
They said that if the UK left the EU, domestic energy bills could be cut by removing VAT on home heating and lighting.
Mr Miliband said he would support action to scrap ""regressive"" VAT on bills, but he said a big campaign to insulate homes should be introduced too.
His fears over the impact of Brexit on climate policy have been widely voiced by environmentalists. Much of our energy and environmental policy is formed in Brussels - including rules on state aid for energy; targets for carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewables; and new product standards.
Standards were a campaign target by Leave supporters who argued that the EU would deny people powerful vacuum cleaners. Experts said efficiency standards would reduce energy cost and emissions without compromising performance.
The EU has brought a huge improvement in UK environment policy on issues like waste, sewage, beaches, air pollution, environmental protection, marine conservation, and resource efficiency - albeit at a cost to taxpayers and bill-payers.
Some of these improvements - like water treatment - entail huge infrastructure investment that won't be undone. And there is no certainty that laws on environment and energy will be watered down in a new government.
In fact, some Leave campaigners argue that on issues like farm subsidies and fishing, the UK will protect the environment better than the EU.
But the Global Warming Policy Forum – influential amongst Conservative MPs – warned in its latest policy note: “Since the UK will need to sail fast and free post-Brexit, the economic engine must be fuelled as cheaply and efficiently as possible, a requirement that is incompatible with currently applicable EU (climate) regulation, and much of it will consequently have to be rejected.”
It pointed to 230 rules affecting energy supply and called for the speedy rejection of three major planks of EU climate policy: the emissions trading scheme, which increases the cost of pollution for big business; the Industrial Emissions Directive which cuts pollution from power plant; and the Renewables Directive, which requires the UK to obtain 15% of total energy from renewables by 2020.
Given that the UK played a major role in the Paris climate deal and has also urged the EU to increase ambition on climate change, it would represent a massive reversal to reject EU energy and climate policy at home.
But environmentalists complain that that policy has already been undermined by wholesale cuts to renewables subsidies imposed by George Osborne.
Mr Miliband was been accused by critics of inadvertently provoking the government’s subsidy cuts by promising during the last election campaign to freeze power bills. His critics say that forced Mr Osborne into a political corner where he was obliged to cut subsidies in order to trim bills.
Mr Miliband rejected that accusation.
Follow Roger on Twitter.","Labour’s former climate change secretary Ed Miliband said ""climate sceptics"" might try to derail the deal if they gained positions of power following the EU referendum. Government sources told BBC that climate change policies would not be affected by the outcome of the EU referendum. The UK government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to meeting climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.

However, there are concerns that leaving the EU could impact the UK's ability to influence and shape EU-wide climate policies. The EU has been a driving force behind efforts to tackle climate change, and the UK has played a significant role in shaping EU climate policies. Some experts argue that leaving the EU could make it harder for the UK to achieve its own climate goals, as it would no longer have access to the EU's emissions trading system and collaborative efforts with other EU countries.

It is unclear if climate sceptics, who deny or downplay the existence of man-made climate change, would have a significant impact on climate policies in the UK following the EU referendum. However, the strong commitment to climate action by the current UK government suggests that any attempts to derail climate policies would likely face opposition."
"It is the third time in four days a Ferrari has been fastest, as the teams reached one-third distance in their preparations for the 2015 season.
Sauber's Marcus Ericsson was second ahead of Lewis Hamilton, whose Mercedes team completed by far the most mileage.
McLaren had another tough day, still struggling with their new Honda engine.
Jenson Button did only 35 laps and was 6.8 seconds off the pace as he was hit initially by a problem with oil levels and then was forced to abandon the day's running following a fuel-pump failure.
McLaren posted 79 laps over four days - compared to more than 500 by Mercedes. But director of engineering Matt Morris insisted the team had had a positive test as they bedded in their relationship with Honda.
""We have had a number of problems,"" Morris said. ""We have had some operational issues - all of us working together as a team for the first time - things you take for granted when you have been with an engine supplier for many years.
""You drop the ball sometimes, like saying getting oil levels wrong and all these sorts of things. We have had a few issues like that.
""We have also had some minor electrical issues, which resulted in a lot of downtime but have actually been relatively easy to fix.
""The main thing is that we have not been burning bodywork or blowing up engines.
""I am pretty happy that we are going to come out of this test with no major issues to resolve.""
Hamilton had a harmless spin at the chicane in the morning but still managed 117 laps as Mercedes completed an impressive overall distance of 1,419 miles in four days.
Hamilton told his team over the car radio: ""Well done, guys. Great first week back.""
On his spin he said: ""It was a bit damp, I was the first on slicks, so I just had a spin.
""But reliability has been pretty special this week. It's one of our highest weeks of mileage.
""The car feels very similar to last year. It's very difficult to pick out any differences, really.""
Lotus also had an encouraging final day as they completed their first test with a Mercedes engine, after switching from Renault last year.

The team, who slipped from fourth to eighth in the championship last season, had initially not planned to be at this test with their new car, but ended up ahead of schedule and ran for two and a half days.
Frenchman Romain Grosjean was sixth fastest and his day was ended by an engine problem, but the team said they were confident the car was a major advance on last year.
""It's a shame it's ended early,"" said trackside operations director Alan Permane. 'It's been going really well, especially as a week ago we did not even expect to be here.
""The car is most definitely a big step forward over last year, even though we are still short of a lot of parts so it's not very representative.
""It's surprising we were running as quickly as we were given that. It's very encouraging - in fact, Romain was just saying that the car feels a lot like the 2013 car. He's a lot happier.'""
The second test is at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya from 19-22 February.

This dominance from Ferrari is a promising sign for the team as they aim to improve on their disappointing 2014 season.

"Bambang Sulistoyo said he believed they had been found - and divers would try to retrieve them on Monday.
They are buried on the seabed underneath the aircraft's debris, officials say.
The possible discovery comes amid intense efforts to find the main fuselage of Flight QZ8501.
It disappeared in bad weather on 28 December with 162 people on board.
The aircraft was flying from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore and is lying 30m (98ft) below the surface of the Java Sea.
Three Indonesian ships had detected signals from two different locations about 3.5km (2 miles) from where the aircraft's tail was discovered, Co-ordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Indroyono Soesilo said.
""The two are close to each other, just about 20 metres [apart],'"" Mr Soesilo said. ""Hopefully, they are the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.""
AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes tweeted on Sunday that he had been ""led to believe"" that the recorders had been found.
But Mr Fernandes said that his ""main concern"" was recovering bodies from the aircraft's fuselage.
Earlier he tweeted: ""Let's hope today is a major breakthrough day and we can find main fuselage.""
An official said earlier that a large object resembling the plane's body had been found in a sonar scan of the search area in the Java Sea.
But Supriyadi, operations co-ordinator for Indonesia's search-and-rescue agency, later told the BBC's Indonesian service that reports that the fuselage had been found had not been confirmed.
Supriyadi has said that if the main body of the plane is found, the first priority of search teams will be to remove the remains of victims.
A team of divers had been sent to investigate, he added, but up until recently poor weather conditions had once again been hampering the search efforts.
Rescue workers have been pulling bodies and wreckage from the sea but progress has been slow. At least 48 bodies have been retrieved so far.
The cause of the crash is unknown but the plane had encountered bad weather and asked for a flight path change before communication was lost.
The flight data recorders are usually housed inside the rear part of the plane.
They are designed to survive a crash and being submerged in water, and contain underwater locator beacons which emit signals for at least 30 days.
Finding them has been one of the top priorities for search teams as they provide crucial clues from the last moments of a flight before it came down.","Bambang Sulistoyo said he believed they had been found - and divers would try to retrieve them on Monday. They are buried on the seabed underneath the aircraft's debris, officials said. The location of the black boxes had been determined using underwater pinger locators, which detect the signals emitted by the flight recorders. The search operation has faced numerous challenges, including strong currents, poor visibility, and the large amount of wreckage in the area. However, the discovery of the black boxes brings hope for answers as to what caused the crash of Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182 on January 9th. The black boxes, which contain crucial data and recordings from the cockpit, will be vital in understanding the sequence of events leading up to the tragedy."
"Sampaoli, 57, guided Sevilla to a fourth-placed finish in La Liga in his only season in charge and the last 16 of the Champions League before losing 3-2 on aggregate to Leicester.
""All parties are satisfied by the agreement reached,"" said a Sevilla statement on Friday.
Argentina sacked Edgardo Bauza last month after eight matches as coach.
Sevilla's statement added: ""This agreement in principle is pending the drafting and presentation of the relevant documents, which must be signed by all parties by next Thursday, 1 June.""
Sampaoli revealed last week that Argentina wanted to appoint him.
""My contract with the club contains clauses which allow me to leave,"" said the Argentine.
""There's a clear desire from my country to have me as coach and I've had a dream of taking that chance.""","Sampaoli, 57, guided Sevilla to a fourth-placed finish in La Liga in his only season in charge and the last 16 of the Champions League before losing 3-2 on aggregate to Leicester City. Despite his impressive performance at Sevilla, Sampaoli took on a new challenge as the manager of the Argentine national team in 2017.

During his tenure with the national team, Sampaoli faced mixed results. Argentina struggled in the World Cup qualifying campaign and barely secured their spot in the tournament. However, Sampaoli was able to guide the team to the round of 16, where they were eliminated by eventual champions France.

Following the World Cup, Sampaoli faced criticism for his tactics and management style. Argentina continued to struggle in international competitions, including a disappointing performance in the 2019"
"It happened at Mini Market on New Row, Tranent, at about 20:15 on Thursday.
A 21-year-old man received minor injuries. Police are appealing for witnesses.

"The Potters led through Shaqiri early on and after Romelu Lukaku levelled from eight yards, the Swiss looped a stunning half-volley over Tim Howard.
Lukaku struck again after the break and Gerard Deulofeu tapped Everton ahead.
But Joselu volleyed his first Premier League goal and Arnautovic won it after being brought down by John Stones.
Relive Stoke's dramatic win at Goodison Park
Follow all the reaction to Saturday's Premier League games
Arnautovic - impressive himself throughout - will be deemed the match winner, but Shaqiri's strike will capture copious column inches in the aftermath of a win which moves Stoke two places above Everton and into ninth.
An ex-Inter Milan and Bayern Munich forward, summer-signing Shaqiri perhaps symbolises the ambition Mark Hughes' side now have and his first goals for the club will raise hopes of many more to come.
Stoke kept eight clean sheets in the 11 league games leading up to this win and although their frugal side went missing at Goodison Park, flair at the other end was on show throughout.
Shaqiri's first from six yards saw the combination of Bojan and Arnautovic craft a sublime team goal, while his second - from a wonderful Bojan pass - saw him reach for the ball and clip it over Tim Howard and into the top corner from 18 yards.
""That is the best goal I have seen this season,"" said Final Score pundit Garth Crooks. ""He knew exactly what he was doing, it is absolutely sublime.""
Everton had lost just once in eight league games before kick-off but with no back-to-back wins in the league this season, their fans could be forgiven for wishing their side packed the killer punch Stoke mustered on Merseyside.
Hughes made no changes to his squad despite a 48-hour turnaround from Saturday's win over Manchester United but the likes of Ibrahim Afellay and Glenn Whelan delivered displays of note, both completing 95% of their passes.
It briefly appeared that substituting Bojan moments before Lukaku pulled a long ball down to fire Everton level at 2-2 would prove key, but after falling behind, Stoke's fresh legs earned their manager a fifth league win in eight games.
Arnautovic delivered a telling cross for substitute Joselu to smash a smart volley home and picked himself up to slam a penalty down the middle despite slipping before making contact.
It was a fitting reward as no Stoke player completed more sprints than the Austrian's 54 in the game and although Shaqiri's brilliance will overshadow such work ethic, the Potters admirably married graft with quality.
Everton's industry and spirit are tough to question after they fought back to lead late on but they will rue the chance to close out the victory having led with just 10 minutes to spare.

There may be some contention around the winning penalty - referee Mark Clattenburg took an age to point to the spot - but even allowing Stoke back into the game having fought so hard to earn a lead was sloppy.
In all, Everton had 15 shots and as many crosses but the end result smacks of the inconsistency which continues to hamper their hopes of a push for a top-four spot.
At the halfway stage of the campaign, they are five points worse off than they were at the same point last season and the gap to Manchester City in fourth is now nine points.
Will Roberto Martinez regret making four changes to the side which won at Newcastle on Boxing Day? His introduction of James McCarthy into the side after a month out injured backfired as the midfielder limped off early on.
In Lukaku, they now boast the Premier League's joint top scorer with Jamie Vardy on 15, but three wins from 10 home matches this season is a damning statistic they must improve quickly if their final league position is to match their ambitions.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez on Stoke's penalty: ""Looking at the replay it shows John Stones touches the ball. That decision is hard to take. To get a decision wrong like that so late in the game makes you feel furious and is unacceptable.""
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: ""The only thing lacking up until today for Shaqiri was goals - performances had been fine - but now he has added that. He has that quality - it's his first mark in terms of goals and I'm sure there will be more to come. It was end to end and I thought both sides came out with great credit.""
Stoke can make it three wins from three if they win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday while Everton host Tottenham 24 hours later.","The Potters led through Shaqiri early on and after Romelu Lukaku levelled from eight yards, the Swiss looped a stunning half-volley over Tim Howard. Lukaku struck again after the break to equalize for Everton, but it was Shaqiri who had the final say. In the dying minutes of the game, he unleashed a powerful long-range shot that found the back of the net, securing a 3-2 victory for Stoke City.

Shaqiri's performance was exceptional, showcasing his technical skills and ability to score from distance. His first goal demonstrated his control and composure, as he calmly finished past the Everton goalkeeper. However, it was his second goal that truly stole the show. With a perfectly timed half-volley, he sent the ball sailing over Howard and into the top corner of the net, leaving everyone in awe of his skill.

While Lukaku's brace was commendable, it was ultimately Shaqiri who proved to be the match-winner. His ability to produce moments of brilliance when it mattered most propelled Stoke City to victory, securing three crucial points for the team.

Overall, it was a thrilling and entertaining match, with both teams showcasing their attacking prowess. However, it was Shaqiri's individual brilliance that ultimately made the difference, cementing his status as the hero of the day."
"It was Team GB's first European gold in the event since 1969 and their run of three minutes 25.05 seconds was the fastest time in the world this year.
Bundy-Davies now hopes to continue her form at the Rio Olympics in August.
""I'm hoping I can make that an Olympic medal as well at the end of the year,"" said the 21-year-old from Wales.
Bundy-Davies saw Great Britain home in the final leg in Amsterdam after strong running from team-mates Emily Diamond, Anyika Onuora, Eilidh Doyle.
""From the moment I got the baton I knew they had already given us a good enough lead for it to be a pretty simple job,"" she added.
""The girls ran absolutely amazing before me so I'm really delighted to get the European gold for the team.""
Bundy-Davies has met the 400m qualifying standard for the Olympics and British Athletics are due to announce their team for Rio on Wednesday.
Legendary former hurdler Colin Jackson has earmarked Bundy-Davies as the likeliest Welsh track and field athlete to win a medal in Brazil, but the 400m runner has previously said she welcomes the ""added pressure"" of being tipped to succeed at Rio.
""It's kind of exciting, but scary at the same time,"" she said after Sunday's race.
""I'm just really looking forward to individually putting down a good performance and then hopefully winning a relay medal with these girls.""
Bundy-Davies won 4x400m bronze at last year's World Championships in Beijing and claimed individual bronze at the 2015 European Indoor Championships.","It was Team GB's first European gold in the event since 1969 and their run of three minutes 25.05 seconds was the fastest time in the world this year. Bundy-Davies was the lead runner for Team GB, setting the pace and giving them a strong start. She handed the baton over to teammates Anyika Onuora, Eilidh Doyle, and Emily Diamond, who all ran impressive legs to maintain their position and secure the gold medal. The team's victory was particularly significant as they defeated strong competitors including Poland, France, and Italy, who finished in second, third, and fourth place respectively. This win has not only put Team GB back on top in European athletics but also served as a powerful reminder of their strength and potential heading into future competitions."
"But beneath the surface, Westminster life seethes with intrigue.
On the government side, the position of the prime minister and the ambitions of would-be successors are the subject of endless speculation, which means that all kinds of occasions can morph into opportunities for possible contenders to, ever so subtly, strut their stuff.
With the elections for select committee chairs due on Wednesday, there are plenty of MPs pursuing influential perches on the committee corridor.
The biggest prize is probably the chair of the Treasury Committee - vacated by Andrew Tyrie, who stood down at the last election; but the chairs of the Education and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committees are also open.
And, as some old-stagers shake their heads, two incumbent chairs, Julian Lewis in Defence, and Crispin Blunt in Foreign Affairs, are being challenged.
Long-serving Foreign Affairs Committee member John Baron is seeking the chair of that committee, as is Tom Tugendhat from the 2015 intake. Another new-ish MP, Johnny Mercer is seeking the chair of Defence - will the torch be seized by a younger generation?
The key to understanding these races is that, where several MPs from one party are contesting a post, the winner is the one with the most appeal to the other parties - so Labour MPs, in effect, will pick the winner in hotly contested elections like the one for the Treasury Committee chair.
Elsewhere the All-Party Parliamentary Groups are springing into action...Margaret Hodge's APPG on tax, which is zeroing-in on a particularly sensitive political issue, is taking shape, and the APPG on cancer is launching its second inquiry into NHS England's Cancer Strategy, which will feed into a 'Britain Against Cancer' conference in Westminster on 5 December.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Defence Questions - providing a final chance for the contenders for the post of Defence Committee chair, the incumbent, Julian Lewis, and his challenger, Johnny Mercer, with a final audition for the job.
The day's legislating is on the second reading of the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Relief from Non-Domestic Rates) Bill - which scraps business rates on new ultrafast broadband lines as part of the government's drive to speed up Britain's move to ultrafast broadband and 5G mobile coverage.
Older telecoms infrastructure will still be taxed as the government seeks to encourage a switch to ""gold standard"" fibre optics rather than upgrades to get better performance from old-style copper telephone lines.
In the Lords (2.30 pm) questions to ministers include one on setting up a Data Ethics Commission from the former CEO of TalkTalk, the Conservative, Baroness Harding of Winscombe. The day's main debate is on the current security situation in the UK - with 20 peers listed to speak at the time of writing.
The Commons meets at 11.30am for Foreign Office Questions (watch out for a bit of competition between Messrs Blunt, Baron and Tugendhat) with any statements or urgent questions following at 12.30pm.
Slightly to everyone's surprise, the Commons will then deal with the detail of the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing Bill - given its second reading this week -  in a committee of the whole House, with report stage and third reading following immediately after.
There has already been some Opposition chuntering that the government should have set up a bill committee, and some speculation about why they have not. Some accuse ministers of trying to bog down the House in legislative chores and general debates, because they dare not put controversial legislation before MPs. Expect these complaints to intensify, if this continues.
One piece of controversial legislation is expected to appear - but only to be presented, not debated. The Great Repeal Bill, as it will not be called, because Commons rules prohibit argumentative titles for legislation, will be formally published this week - with rumour pointing for Tuesday as the day for the formalities to be enacted. The actual second reading debate will not be until September, at the earliest.
The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford, is on Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 - an emergency power which allows the police to remove an apparently mentally disordered person from a public place to a place of safety, for up to 72 hours.
In Westminster Hall, the former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper - now on the backbenches - leads a debate (9.30am-11am) on balancing the public finances. There has been a lot of internal criticism that the Conservatives have failed to make the intellectual case for austerity, in the face of Jeremy Corbyn's attacks on spending cuts.
The newly elected Lib Dem Layla Moran discusses the role of children's centres in tackling social inequality (11am-11.30 am) and in the afternoon, Labour's Lucy Powell has a longer debate (2.30pm- 4pm) on government policies on social mobility - her aim is to give MPs a chance to debate the recent Social Mobility Commission report, Time for change: an assessment of government policies on social mobility 1997-2017, with ministers.
She has been carving out a niche as a social mobility campaigner since she left the Labour frontbench, and will use the debate to renew her calls (made with Nicky Morgan and Nick Clegg in the last Parliament) for more cross-party joint working on what works for social mobility.  With the sensitive subject of grammar schools likely to feature, it may also see a bit of last-minute campaigning from candidates for the chair of the Education Committee.
The SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron has a debate (4.30pm-5.30pm) on consultation with disabled people on the effect on their services of the UK leaving the EU.
In the Lords (2.30pm) the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by an order to extend non-jury trials in Northern Ireland.
Then peers will turn to the second reading of the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Bill - which would allow for part time and flexible working arrangements for armed forces personnel: the idea is that the conditions of service must offer recruits a career that better reflects the realities of modern life - it is hoped that allowing greater flexibility over how long and where people work will help attract and keep the talent the forces need.
There will also be a short debate on the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region and the steps being taken to de-escalate tensions and encourage Qatar to engage with its neighbours about their concerns about extremism.
The Commons begins (11.30am) with International Development Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.
These occasions may not have much cut-through with the public most of the time, but are increasingly critical for Conservative Party morale.
The rest of the day is devoted to a debate on the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry. One strand of this is the increasing pressure from senior MPs for some kind of parliamentary role in drawing up the terms of reference of major inquiries, and appointing the chair.
The PM is the 'sponsoring minister' for the inquiry and as a result the department handling arrangements is the Cabinet Office.
In Westminster Hall, the first debate (9.30am-11am) is on negotiations on the UK's future Euratom membership - the Labour MP Albert Owen (one of the contenders for the chair of the business and energy select committee) will warn of problems ahead if the UK leaves the EU atomic energy agency without making transitional arrangements to allow for the purchase of nuclear materials and technology from member nations, and maintain monitoring arrangements for British nuclear facilities.
An amendment highlighting the possible problems from leaving Euratom as part of the Brexit process did gain some traction during the debates on the bill to invoke Article 50, earlier this year, and Mr Owen anticipates some cross-party support and pressure on the government, during this debate.
In the afternoon, the Telford MP, Lucy Allan, leads a debate (2.30pm-4pm) on the challenges facing new towns.
But it is the debate on abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections (4.30pm-5.30pm) that promises to be the most rancorous of the week. Expect much finger-pointing, with a number of MPs seeking payback for some bruising experiences during the campaign. The debate will be led by the Conservative backbencher, Simon Hart, who says many candidates faced ""numerous acts of vandalism, abuse, intimidation and general thuggishness - especially online"".
He wants to use the debate to raise the wider question of the impact of all this on recruitment and retention of candidates, public attitudes to voicing support for individuals, reporting and ultimately electoral outcomes. Intriguingly he also wants to pose the question: ""what is acceptable online activity from opponents in public office?""
In the Lords (3pm) there's an interesting looking question to the Leader of the House from Labour's Lord Soley on proposals ""to create a close and constructive relationship between the House of Lords and the European Parliament"".
Then peers come to the final frontier, the second reading of the Space Industry Bill - it is less exciting than it sounds; the bill is concerned with providing a legal framework for a projected British spaceport.
Space technology is one of the UK's unsung industries, and the government is keen to expand it, by licensing a British spaceport ahead of rival countries like Portugal, which wants a launch facility in the Azores.
There are a number of rival sites in Cornwall and Scotland which might become the home for a launch facility, although the vehicles concerned will be aircraft lifting space vehicles to high altitude rather than Cape Canaveral style rockets. Before the election, the Commons Science and Technology Committee had run an inquiry into a draft version of the bill, and now peers will boldly legislate where no peer has legislated before.
That is followed by a short debate on risks to NHS sustainability arising from the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union - led by the former health minister, Lord Warner, who resigned the Labour whip in 2015 and now sits as a non-affiliated peer.
Of course, in the Lords, their select committees are up and running - and their EU Committee meets (at 4pm) with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, to discuss Brexit, the first round of negotiations, engagement with Parliament, citizens' rights and devolution.
The Commons opens (9.30 am) with Transport Questions, which could see the debut of whoever is elected as the new chair of the Transport Select Committee. And then comes the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.
The main debate is a Commemoration of Passchendaele, the third battle of Ypres, one of the bloodiest of the First World War. The figures are disputed but there were an estimated 240,000 British, 8,525 French and 260,000 German casualties. One MP to watch will be the Conservative military historian Keith Simpson, who intends to look at the blunders by the generals who planned the allied offensive.
Expect a number of MPs to speak about the sacrifices made by their ancestors, and to point to the losses sustained by New Zealand soldiers.
The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Alec Shelbrooke is on the prosecution of driving offences committed on private land - it follows from the death of nine-year-old Harry Whitlam killed by a drunk driver in a farmyard, in 2015.
Because this happened on private land the driver could only be prosecuted under health and safety legislation - and Mr Shelbrooke will be calling for a change in the law.
In the Lords (11 am) the Plaid Cymru peer Lord Wigley has a question on the sensitive issue of changes to the Barnett formula for Wales and Scotland arising from additional financial provision for Northern Ireland which follows the government's deal with the Northern Ireland Democratic Unionists.
A series of Labour backbench debates on public service issues follows, with Baroness Andrews raising the impact of deregulation on public services, health and safety;  Lord Haskel the cap on public sector pay and Lord Kennedy of Southwark on local government finance and arrangements beyond 2020.
There's also a short debate on security challenges and related human rights violations on the Korean peninsula led by Lord Alton of Liverpool.
Neither House sits on Friday.","But beneath the surface, Westminster life seethes with intrigue. On the government side, the position of the prime minister and the ambitions of would-be successors are the subject of endless speculation and plotting. MPs from the ruling party jockey for positions of power and influence, aligning themselves with different factions and courting support from their colleagues. Cabinet reshuffles and political maneuvering behind closed doors are common occurrences, as politicians strive to climb the ladder of success and secure their place in the inner circle of power.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are constantly strategizing and plotting ways to undermine the government and gain electoral advantage. Shadow cabinet members and party leaders engage in fierce debates and power struggles, seeking to shape party policy and position themselves as viable alternatives to the ruling party.

Media attention and public scrutiny add fuel to the fire, with journalists and political commentators scrutinizing every move and decision made by those in power. Whispers of secret alliances, backroom deals, and hidden agendas circulate within the political corridors, feeding into a perpetual cycle of intrigue and speculation.

Outside of the official political sphere, lobbyists, interest groups, and powerful individuals exert their influence and work behind the scenes to shape policy outcomes in their favor. The intertwined relationships between politicians, business figures, and media moguls further contribute to the complex web of intrigue that permeates Westminster.

Ultimately, the world of Westminster politics is a high-stakes game where ambition, power, and personal rivalries drive the actions and decisions of those involved. While the surface may present a polished image of democratic governance, the reality beneath is a tumultuous and shadowy landscape of political maneuvering and intrigue."
"Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visited the devastated port of Minamisanriku, where more than 1,350 people are missing or dead.
The couple have been to quake-affected areas further to the south but this is their first visit to the region worst hit in the 11 March disaster.
Work to cool reactors at the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant is continuing.
The earthquake and subsequent tsunami knocked out cooling systems at the six-reactor Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
A 20-km (12 mile) no-go zone is being enforced around the plant as workers pump water into reactor buildings to prevent fuel rods overheating.
The 9.0-magnitude earthquake is now known to have killed 14,517 people, with another 11,432 still missing, according to the latest figures from the National Police Agency.
In Minamisanriku, a port town of about 20,000 people, more than 3,800 homes were destroyed by the tsunami, forcing many residents into evacuation shelters.
The imperial couple visited a gymnasium in the town where 200 people are living.
""I'm thankful he has come so far. It makes me so happy,"" 73-year-old Mitsuko Oikawa, whose house was washed away, told the Associated Press news agency.
Officials say the couple will travel further north to Iwate prefecture next week and then visit Fukushima residents forced from their homes by the nuclear crisis in March.
On Wednesday Junichi Matsumoto, general manager of plant operator Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power Company), said: ""We are injecting more water into the No 1 reactor. We began doing so at 1002 today, and we are increasing the injection of water.""
Increasing the water flow will allow engineers to see if there are any leaks, before moving to fully flood the containment vessel - a steel and concrete shell that houses the reactor - in a procedure called water entombment.
The containment vessel in reactor No 2 is thought to be damaged. Highly radioactive water thought to have leaked from there is being transferred to storage on site, forcing Tepco to pump less contaminated water into the sea.
Tepco said it planned to seal damaged sections in the No 2 reactor with cement so water would not leak out.
The company says it will take up to nine months to stabilise the plant. Eighty-thousand residents have been moved from the area and bans imposed on some local food products.
On Wednesday Japan's sovereign rating outlook was cut to negative by Standard & Poor's in the wake of the disaster.
The ratings agency said reconstruction efforts were likely to further increase Japan's debt levels.","Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visited the devastated port of Minamisanriku, where more than 1,350 people are missing or dead.

They visited temporary shelters and met with survivors, offering words of encouragement and sympathy.

During their visit to Minamisanriku, the Emperor and Empress expressed their sadness at the extent of the destruction and devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami. They offered their condolences to the families who lost loved ones and assured the survivors of their unwavering support.

The Emperor and Empress also took the time to listen to the stories of survivors, who shared their harrowing experiences of the disaster. They empathized with their pain and commended their resilience in the face of such tragedy.

Their visit to the affected areas served as a symbol of solidarity and compassion for the victims and the nation as a whole. It highlighted the importance of national unity in times of crisis and the role of the royal family in providing solace and emotional support to the people.

Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko's visit also had a significant impact on the international community, as it showcased Japan's determination to recover and rebuild after the disaster. It emphasized the resilience and spirit of the Japanese people, garnering admiration and support from around the world.

In addition to their visit to Minamisanriku, the Emperor and Empress actively participated in various relief efforts and fundraisers to aid the victims and support the reconstruction process. Their commitment and involvement in the recovery efforts further strengthened the nation's resolve to overcome the aftermath of the disaster."

"Dorothy Gardner had alleged she attended an April 2015 hustings event in Downpatrick, during which the issue of same-sex parenting was discussed.
Jim Wells made controversial remarks about same-sex relationships. He later resigned as health minister.
A judge released Gardner on her own bail of £250 pending appeal.
Ms Gardner, of Killycanavan Road, made a formal complaint to police after the hustings which included a statement claiming she had been at the event and heard the remarks.
The Downpatrick Court heard that a detective investigating the complaint realised that the 49-year-old's account of the event did not add up.
She claimed she was with a group of protestors, wearing tops with the inscription ""I'm proud to be gay"" on the front and ""No politician will tell me who to love"" on the back.
She claimed she had heckled Mr Wells and in response, the DUP's Nelson McCausland and Gregory Campbell had laughed at her.
Gardner also claimed to police she had video footage supporting her story.
The court heard that Mr McCausland and Mr Campbell were not at the event and that no video footage was produced by Gardner. Nor did CCTV footage demonstrate any such protest group attended.
Gardner also claimed to be suffering from cancer, but the court was told that no evidence had been provided and she had not attended a probation appointment to discuss a pre-sentence report.
The court was also told that Ms Gardner had claimed to be at the home of a lesbian couple in Rathfriland when Jim Wells came to the door canvassing.
Police investigations revealed that this was also not true and that the couple in question had no knowledge of Ms Gardner.
The court heard that Ms Gardner admitted she had wanted to ""get Jim Wells"".
The judge said that fabricating statements attacked the very heart of due process.
The judge said the false statement made by Ms Gardner not only wasted police time but could impact on legitimate complaints from the LGBT community.
Speaking outside court, Mr Wells said he felt ""totally vindicated"" by the sentence.
""My political career was destroyed as a result of totally false allegations made against me,"" he said.
""I was forced to resign as health minister and over the last 16 months, I have been subjected to a torrent of abuse based on these false allegations.
""If it had not been for the diligence of a senior PSNI detective, I could have faced a very serious charge, and I am very grateful to him for his work on this case.""","Dorothy Gardner had alleged she attended an April 2015 hustings event in Downpatrick, during which the issue of same-sex parenting was discussed.

And while Wales saw an increase in visitors in 2014, visitors to the UK as a whole were down 7% on 2013.
Ken Skates, Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, said: ""These figures are absolutely fantastic and show that Wales is ahead of the game.
""Getting to 10 million visitors is an important milestone and Wales is gaining market share.""

"Mrs May pledged to reduce the numbers claiming in Britain while taking in the ""most vulnerable"" refugees from conflict zones around the world.
She also said high migration made a ""cohesive society"" impossible.
Her speech was criticised by business groups, with the Institute of Directors attacking its ""irresponsible rhetoric"".
Net migration into the UK currently stands at a record high, reaching 330,000 in the year to March.
The home secretary told the Conservative Party conference Britain ""does not need"" net migration at current levels, saying the net economic effect was ""close to zero"" at best.
In other developments:
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May's comments on immigration were ""extraordinarily tough"" and ""utterly uncompromising"".
Beforehand, Prime Minister David Cameron had said he agreed with what she was to say.
Addressing the party conference in Manchester, she said the main way of claiming asylum - by people already in the country - had failed, and rewarded ""wealthiest, the luckiest and the strongest"".
The UK would not adopt a common EU policy ""in a thousand years"" she said, promising a ""new British approach"", including tougher treatment for people who have travelled to the UK from other safe countries.
People who have ""spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere"" will not have an automatic right to stay in the UK, she said.
Instead, priority will be given to ""helping the most vulnerable people in the world's most dangerous places"", she pledged.
The first ever ""annual asylum strategy"" will be published next year, along with a register of people and organisations able to accommodate refugees.
The overhaul also includes a new system of ""safe return reviews"" so asylum seekers can be returned home when their country is assessed as being safe, and the use of alternative ID documents to remove failed asylum seekers who do not have their own passports.
Mrs May also said refugees should not be ""conflated"" with economic migrants.
The ""desire for a better life is perfectly understandable"" she said, but ""there is a limit to the amount of immigration any country can and should take"".
Controls are needed, she said: ""Because when immigration is too high, when the pace of change is too fast, it's impossible to build a cohesive society. It's difficult for schools and hospitals and core infrastructure like housing and transport to cope.""
Wages are also forced down and some people ""forced out of work altogether"", she added: ""But even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year.""
Mrs May said immigrants could fill skills gaps, but said ""not every person coming to Britain right now is a skilled electrician, engineer or doctor"".
She said evidence showed that ""at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero"" and that there was ""no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade"".
The home secretary hit back at critics of her planned crackdown on student visas, saying ""too many"" students were not returning when their visas run out.
""So I don't care what the university lobbyists say: the rules must be enforced.
""Students, yes. Over-stayers, no. And the universities must make this happen.""

Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said he was ""astonished"" by the home secretary's ""irresponsible rhetoric and pandering to anti-immigration sentiment"".
""It is yet another example of the home secretary turning away the world's best and brightest, putting internal party politics ahead of the country, and helping our competitor economies instead of our own,"" he said, adding that ""the myth of the job-stealing-immigrant is nonsense"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, John Cridland, of the CBI, said the government was ending up penalising skilled workers who ""add hugely to the collective economic strength of the economy"".
Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said the asylum changes were ""thoroughly chilling"".
""The home secretary's idea that the few refugees who reach Britain's shores under their own steam are not in need of protection is fundamentally flawed,"" he said.
""Becoming a refugee is not solely the privilege of the poor or infirm.""
UKIP accused the Conservatives of ""meaningless targets and use PR bluster"", saying immigration could only be controlled by leaving the EU.
Ministers have admitted missing their target to reduce net migration below 100,000, blaming the scale of migration from within Europe.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said he agreed with Mrs May's comments on the subject, saying integrating new arrivals was ""more difficult if you have excessive levels of migration"".
The PM also said he was ""incredibly proud"" the UK had built one of the ""most successful multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracies anywhere in the world"".
But he said that for an ""integrated, successful society you have to make sure there are enough school places and that hospitals aren't overcrowded"".
According to the latest figures released in August, net migration of EU citizens was 183,000, up 53,000 from the year ending March 2014.
The number of those arriving from countries outside the EU was still larger, with net migration measured at 196,000, up 39,000 on a year earlier.","Mrs May pledged to reduce the numbers claiming in Britain while taking in the ""most vulnerable"" refugees from conflict zones around the world. She also said high migration made a negative impact on wages, public services, and social cohesion. She proposed a more controlled immigration system that would prioritize the needs of the British people and ensure that immigrants contribute to the economy and society.

Mrs May emphasized the importance of safeguarding the national interest and maintaining control over immigration policies. She argued that a fair system should not discriminate against people of different nationalities but should consider factors such as skills, education, and financial independence. Additionally, she stressed the need for effective integration measures to help immigrants become part of British society.

The goal was to strike a balance between welcoming refugees fleeing conflict and persecution and not overwhelming the country's resources. Mrs May believed that by reducing overall migration numbers, the government could better manage and support those in need while addressing concerns raised by the British public regarding immigration."
"The star, who plays villain Lord Roderick in the film, described the process as ""humiliating"".
""I can't stand 3D, I really can't. I'm happy to go watch it but I don't work shooting in 3D. It's not fun,"" he said.
Tucci was nominated for an Oscar in 2009 for his role in The Lovely Bones and starred in The Hunger Games.
Brian Singer's adventure, based on the fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk, also stars Nicholas Hoult and Ewan McGregor.
Tucci said: ""Nobody will tell you it's so fun shooting in 3D. We were all dressed in stupid outfits.
""It was pretty funny sitting around in chairs, everybody with little caps on, tight spandex things with little balls all over you. I'm not kidding.  It's so humiliating!""
He added: ""We had a lot of difficulty with the cameras, they broke down a lot and the crew was cursing them.
""Ultimately it looks amazing and you have to be patient, but when you're sitting around for 13 hours a day in soaking wet leather doublets, and you maybe get two shots off a day, it's kind of frustrating.""
The actor, who won an Emmy Award for his performance in HBO TV film Winchell and also starred in The Devil Wears Prada, said the new technology made it less interesting for actors.
""You end up doing a lot of stuff in front of green screen, that's not really very exciting for an actor,"" he said. ""We're probably going to be replaced by digital-something soon.
""I'm hoping either I'll have enough money I won't have to worry about it at that point, or I'll be dead... They need voices for animation, but soon they'll figure that out too.

It will be released in UK cinemas on 22 March.","The star, who plays villain Lord Roderick in the film, described the process as ""humiliating"". ""I can't stand 3D, I really can't. I'm happy to go watch it but I don't enjoy acting in it,"" the star stated. ""The whole process of wearing those bulky glasses and having cameras pointed at your face from all angles, it's just uncomfortable and unnatural.""

The actor further explained that the extra layer of depth provided by 3D technology makes it difficult for him to gauge his own performance. ""I like to be able to see my work as I'm doing it, to make adjustments and understand how it's coming across. With 3D, everything feels so exaggerated and distorted, it's hard to get a true sense of what I'm actually doing.""

Despite his personal aversion to 3D, the star emphasized that he understood its appeal and recognized its popularity among audiences. ""I know there's a market for it and people enjoy the immersive experience it provides. It's just not my cup of tea, I suppose.""

When asked about the possibility of future roles in 3D films, the actor expressed his reluctance. ""I would prefer to stick to traditional filmmaking techniques. I feel more comfortable and in control that way. But who knows, never say never in this industry.""

In conclusion, it is clear that the star has reservations about working in 3D films due to the discomfort and the challenges it poses to his acting process. While he respects its popularity, he personally prefers traditional filmmaking methods and is unlikely to pursue future roles in 3D projects."

He was an integral part of the team known as the ""Busby Babes,"" managed by the legendary Sir Matt Busby. The team was composed of young players who had become the backbone of the club's success.

On February 6, 1958, the team was returning from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade. The plane, carrying the team, crashed during takeoff in Munich, Germany. The tragedy shocked the football world and left an indelible mark on Manchester United.

Gregg was one of the survivors of the crash and played a crucial role in helping rescue his teammates and other survivors from the wreckage. Despite his own injuries, he demonstrated remarkable bravery and selflessness. As a result of the crash, he suffered from survivor's guilt for many years.

""I often wondered why I was spared when so many others lost their lives,"" Gregg said. ""It was a heavy burden to carry, but I tried to honor the memory of my teammates by continuing to play the game I loved.""

After the crash, Gregg returned to playing football and went on to have a successful career as a goalkeeper. He played for several clubs, including Stoke City and Everton, and also represented the Northern Ireland national team.

Although the memory of the Munich air crash never faded, Gregg found solace in his family and the support of the football community"
"War movie Man Down, which also stars Gary Oldman, Jai Courtney and Kate Mara, made £7 on its opening weekend.
Or - to put it another way - the film sold one adult ticket.
To put that into perspective, Beauty and the Beast took a further £6.75m over the weekend.
Why so low? Well, to be fair, it did only open in one place: the Reel Cinema in Burnley.
The screening was held to coincide with the film's simultaneous release on digital platforms.
The cinema has since told the BBC it has sold a further four tickets - including two on Wednesday.
And while the popularity of the film has not gone through the roof, the staff member said there had been ""quite a few"" calls from the media.
The film's appearance in just one cinema is likely to have been done to secure reviews in the media.
But Man Down has not fared well with the critics. The Daily Telegraph says Man Down is a ""bomb site of a film"" and gave it one star, while The Guardian's two-star review calls it ""irredeemable"".
The i is slightly more favourable, giving the film three stars. It is ""impossible to fault Shia LaBeouf's commitment to the lead role"" of an ex-marine who has post-traumatic stress disorder, its writer says.
Other films released last weekend that only opened at one cinema include Guru, which grossed £17, and horror film The Void, which grossed £1,163, according to figures from the British Film Institute.
And last year, Beauty and the Beast and Harry Potter actress Emma Watson's film Colonia, also known as The Colony, made just £47 over its opening weekend in the UK.
But we still have an unanswered question: who was the one LaBeouf fan who bought that ticket?
If you want to catch it on the big screen there's just one screening in Burnley left - tomorrow at 12:20 BST.
There are only 78 seats left though, so you had better be quick.

"Mr Blair, who campaigned for a vote to stay in the EU, said such an outcome was unlikely but that ""the debate continues"" despite June's Leave vote.
He told French radio station Europe 1: ""Who made the rule that we have to stop the debate now?""
PM Theresa May has said the UK will not stay in the EU ""by the back door"".
On Thursday her cabinet agreed to ""push ahead"" with triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal two-year process for leaving the EU.
Speaking in French, Mr Blair said Mrs May - who also backed a Remain vote - had to make her ""Brexit means Brexit"" statement to unite her party and appease the right-wing press in the aftermath of the referendum.
""For the rest of us, we are free to have a debate,"" he said.
There was currently ""confusion"" over the way forward because ""we do not know the terms of Brexit"", said Mr Blair.
""We have done something rather bizarre with Brexit,"" said the former Labour leader.
""It's like moving house without having seen the new house. We have made an agreement to exchange, but we don't yet know the terms of Brexit, we don't know the costs and the consequences.""
He added: ""There will come a moment when we have had the negotiations and we can see the terms we are being offered by the rest of Europe and we will be able to say that it is a good idea or perhaps that it is a bad idea with major consequences.""
Asked whether it was possible the decision could be reversed with the UK staying in the EU, Mr Blair said at the moment, this was unlikely.
""But the debate continues, and I think it is possible, yes.""
The vote to leave, Mr Blair said, had been a reaction against austerity, globalisation and immigration.
Mr Blair's comments come after former civil service chief Lord O'Donnell suggested Britain could remain in a ""more loosely aligned"" European Union if public opinion changed.
Brexit campaigners have called on Mrs May to invoke Article 50 immediately, but the PM has indicated this will not happen until the start of 2017 at the earliest.","Mr Blair, who campaigned for a vote to stay in the EU, said such an outcome was unlikely but that ""the debate continues"" despite June's Leave vote. He told French newspaper Le Monde that there are ""lots of things to revisit"" in the debate on Brexit and that these issues should be discussed ""calmly and seriously"". However, he also acknowledged that many people voted to leave the EU due to concerns over immigration and that these factors cannot be ignored. Overall, Blair emphasized the importance of finding a compromise and ensuring that any decision made is in the best interests of the UK and its relationship with Europe."
"There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered.
But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies.
The Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created.
On 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.
The devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened.
80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.
Even then, Japan didn't surrender.
Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
Shortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.
World War Two was over.
When the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.
The blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.
There were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.
Thousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.
But the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.
The nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.
Thousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.
Japan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).
The allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.
However fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.
Japan had been at war for many years.
It had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.
Everywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.
They treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.
US President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.
The atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.
President Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.
US President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.
There were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.
Some historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.
America and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.
It was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.
Although the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.
The way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.
Many people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.
Today, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.
Some campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.
Others say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used.","There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered. But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies. Yes, that is correct. While Germany's surrender in Europe on May 7, 1945, marked the end of World War II in Europe, the war continued in the Pacific against Japan. The Pacific War had been raging since 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States and its allies into the conflict. The Allied forces, primarily consisting of the United States, Britain, Australia, and other countries, were engaged in intense fighting against Japanese forces across the Pacific theater.

Throughout the war, the Pacific theater witnessed brutal battles, including the iconic battles of Midway, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, among others. The fighting involved not only ground forces but also intense naval and aerial warfare. The Allied forces were steadily pushing back Japanese forces, island by island, in a series of hard-fought campaigns.

The turning point in the Pacific came with the United States' development and use of atomic bombs. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, followed by another on Nagasaki on August 9. These devastating attacks forced Japan's surrender. On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, effectively ending the war in the Pacific.

It is important to note that the celebrations in Europe following Germany's surrender did not overshadow the ongoing conflict in the Pacific. The war in the Pacific was recognized as a distinct theater of operations, and once Japan surrendered, it marked the official end of World War II."

"Towell, 25, died in hospital on 30 September, the day after his bout with Welshman Evans in Glasgow.
Almost six months on, Evans has revealed a meeting with Towell's mother gave him the strength to carry on.
""I did not want to be seen. I did not even feel like going out,"" he told Jason Mohammad on BBC Radio Wales.
Evans, 25, has returned to training and hopes to fight again in May, but initially struggled to come to terms with what happened.
He said all he was worried about was Towell's family, including partner Chloe and son Rocco.
""I was just in the house, in my bedroom, I was struggling to eat,"" he said.
""My heart was broken by what happened that night and I cried for days and days.
""I was low, but it was not about me. I didn't want it to be about me, that's why I couldn't go out.""
Towell was knocked down twice by Evans before the referee stopped their fight.
And Evans said a meeting with his opponent's mother Tracey at the Scot's funeral was a turning point for him.
""It was frightening,"" he said. ""I didn't know what reception I would get.
""I was so glad I went because the reception I got, not only from his family, but friends of Mike and the Scottish people in general was so supportive.
""I came out of the chapel and walked down the steps and a car pulled up and Mike's mum got out. She gave me a big hug and a kiss and she said: 'Stop being silly.'
""I admire the strength of that woman.""
Evans was due to fight for the Welsh welterweight title last weekend, but had to pull out with an elbow injury.
He is now hoping to return to the ring in May, and wants to fight for the British title as the mandatory challenger.
Evans wants to win that belt not just for himself, but for Towell too, and his family.
""They asked that when I fight for the British title they can purchase tickets off me and come and support me,"" he said.
""I think that is fantastic. Now, when I go to fight, it won't only be for me, it will be for Mike too.""","Towell, 25, died in hospital on 30 September, the day after his bout with Welshman Evans in Glasgow. Almost six months on, Evans has revealed a meeting with Towell's mother and expressed his condolences to her. He shared that he had been deeply affected by Towell's death and has been struggling with feelings of guilt and remorse ever since. Evans stated that he had no ill intentions during the fight and never wanted to cause any harm to Towell.

During the meeting, Evans spoke with Towell's mother about their lives and experiences leading up to the tragic event. He apologized for what happened and assured her that he will carry the weight of it for the rest of his life.

Towell's mother, on the other hand, appeared to be understanding and forgiving towards Evans. She acknowledged that accidents can happen in boxing and that they are part of the sport. She emphasized the importance of learning from such incidents and working towards improving the safety measures in the sport.

Evans also revealed that he has been seeking therapy and counseling to cope with the aftermath of the incident. He hopes to use his experience to raise awareness about the risks and consequences of boxing and advocate for better safety protocols.

The meeting between Evans and Towell's mother is seen as a step towards healing and reconciliation for both parties involved. It serves as a reminder of the human side of professional boxing and the impact it can have on individuals' lives. The hope is that this tragedy will prompt further conversations and actions to ensure the safety of fighters in the future."

"Middlesbrough has the highest number of asylum seekers in the UK. Around one in every 186 people in the town is seeking refugee status, well over the government guidelines of no more than one in every 200 of the local population.
But many of the refugees are skilled professionals such as doctors or pharmacists, skills that happen to be in short supply in the area.
I have been to meet the foreign doctors who are participating in the scheme. Unable to practise their profession at home, they are embracing the opportunity to use their skills in an understaffed NHS.
Rouni Youssef, 27, picks up a patient's notes from the trolley outside the curtained cubicle and begins to thumb through the details.
""Interesting,"" he mutters to himself. ""I think we should do an MRI.""
I ask him what the day ahead on the hospital ward is looking like but Dr Youssef does not hear me. He is focused on the medical details before him, his eyes flicking feverishly over the scans like a sleuth over clues.
""Maybe some kidney malfunction here,"" he says.
Dr Youssef is polite and friendly towards me but I know I am holding him back from what he would rather be doing. It is, after all, what he has dreamed of doing all his life and what he has spent so many years training to do.
""I'm a Kurd from Aleppo,"" he shrugs. ""And I'm a medical doctor but it just became too unsafe to stay in Syria and in 2014, I had to flee.
""I ended up here in Middlesbrough with nothing: no friends, no family and no career. I couldn't be a doctor any more. You can't imagine how that feels. It was like someone had cut off a body part.
""I was nothing and I had to start from scratch.""
But thanks to the scheme run by the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust and a refugee charity called Investing in People and Culture, Dr Youssef once again is sporting a stethoscope around his neck.
He is currently on an unpaid clinical placement at the University Hospital of North Tees but he has just taken the second part of his Plab exams (an assessment conducted by the General Medical Council which all overseas doctors from outside the EEA must pass before they can legally practise medicine in the UK). If he passes, he will start applying for jobs in September.
""I'd love to be a consultant paediatrician,"" he admits shyly. ""Babies are such dear little creatures - they're like angels, you know?""
Dr Jane Metcalf, deputy medical director at the hospital, pops down to the ward to find out how his latest exams have gone.
She describes the Resettlement Programme For Overseas Doctors as primarily a humanitarian project to get skilled healthcare professionals back into practice but she also admits that, since the North East has a shortage of qualified doctors, it is also in the trust's interests to use their refugee resources.
The current scheme comprises 11 doctors and one pharmacist, from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan and the Congo.
""It's a win-win situation,"" Dr Metcalf explains. ""Although the training is rigorous, the cost is low... to help the doctors through their exams and English tuition it's about Â£5,000 per doctor and when you compare that to the Â£250,000 it takes to train someone in the UK through medicine, it's pretty cost-effective.
""If we can get doctors like Rouni back into practice within a year that would be a tremendous achievement.""
The biggest hurdle for the doctors though is passing the extremely high level, but requisite, English exam.
In an upstairs room at Middlesbrough library, the other doctors on the pilot scheme are learning about the inappropriate use of colloquial English in the written form.
Everyone is grumbling about the finicky example on the white board which, despite being a native speaker and having a university degree in English, even makes me pause for thought.
Eli, a GP from Congo, has had a long and difficult battle to win refugee status and was unable to join the scheme until his asylum papers were granted. While waiting however, he volunteered for the Alzheimer's Society and is now determined to work in geriatric medicine.
""We are refugees, yes,"" he smiles. ""But we are doctors too. We don't take this opportunity for granted. Before this programme we had no road, no route. Now we have hope again. And we can give something back.""
Ahmad, from Afghanistan, was just months away from completing his medical training as a specialist in paediatric orthopaedics when his life was threatened by the Taliban, forcing him and his family to flee Kabul.
""Now I'm optimistic for the future,"" he says. ""I know that one day soon I will practise my passion again.""
Outside the library I meet Bini Araia, founder of Investing in People and Culture, the charity working in partnership with North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust. He tells me that before the scheme's existence, many of the refugee surgeons and doctors, under pressure from their local job centre, were resigned to a life in the UK working in factories, garages or supermarkets.
""But we have a ready-made skill set!"" he tells me. ""And it's great to show with this programme that refugees can benefit UK society.""
Back on the ward at the hospital, there are no ""baby angels"" for Dr Youssef to treat today. Instead, his mentor, consultant physician Dr Sue Jones, asks him to join her as she examines an elderly patient who has been complaining of acute hip pain. Dr Youssef jogs eagerly to the patient's bedside.
""Well hello sir!"" he beams. ""And how are you feeling today? Is it really true you're 101?"" He squats down and holds the man's hand, joking with him and reassuring him. I catch Dr Jones's eye. ""Isn't he impressive?"" she mouths delightedly.
Dr Metcalf wants to encourage other NHS trusts to implement the resettlement scheme for refugee doctors, something Dr Youssef welcomes.
""When I first walked back on to the ward,"" he remembers, ""it felt like I had been fasting for 18 hours and then someone gave me a sip of cold, delicious water.""
We walk together to the Rapid Assessment clinic.
""I want to be a doctor here in Middlesbrough,"" he continues, ""because the people are so friendly."" Then he grins.""But the local accent here, it's a bit, um, fresh, isn't it?""
Emma Jane Kirby reports for BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.","Middlesbrough has the highest number of asylum seekers in the UK. Around one in every 186 people in the town is seeking refugee status, well over the government guidelines of one in every 2000 people. This high number of asylum seekers in Middlesbrough has put immense strain on local resources and services, including housing, healthcare, and education.

The reasons for this high concentration of asylum seekers in Middlesbrough are complex. One factor could be the town's history of industry decline and high unemployment rates, which may make it a more attractive destination for individuals seeking refuge and better opportunities. Additionally, the town's relatively low cost of living compared to other parts of the UK may also contribute to its appeal.

The local authorities in Middlesbrough have been struggling to cope with the influx of asylum seekers, as they face financial and logistical challenges in providing adequate support and services. This includes finding suitable accommodation, ensuring access to healthcare and education, and addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups such as children and survivors of trauma or torture.

The government guidelines regarding the number of asylum seekers that a local area should accommodate are often not met, which can lead to strained resources and increased tension within communities. Some argue that more equitable distribution of asylum seekers across the country would help alleviate the burden on these areas and enable better support for those seeking refuge.

It is important to note that seeking asylum is a legal right, and individuals fleeing persecution or violence have the right to seek protection in another country. However, the challenges that arise from the concentration of asylum seekers in certain areas highlight the need for better coordination and support from national and local authorities to ensure effective integration and support for both refugees and host communities."
"Zack Davies, 26, targeted Dr Sarandev Bhambra at a Tesco store in Mold, Flintshire, in a racially motivated revenge assault for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
Davies, of Mold, admitted wounding with intent but denied attempted murder.
He was convicted at Mold Crown Court on Thursday.
He will be sentenced on 11 September.
Dr Bhambra was walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when he felt a ""huge blow"" to the back of his head from the 30cm (12in) machete.
During the trial, shopper Leanne Jones said she heard the words ""white power"" and said Davies was acting ""like a lunatic"" as he hacked Dr Bhambra with the machete.
Another witness heard Davies say: ""Come here, this is for Lee Rigby"".
Dr Bhambra suffered two cuts to his scalp which went down to the bone and a cut to his back which went down to the muscle.
The injury to his left hand caused major nerve, artery and tendon damage and he was in surgery for five hours.
Dr Bhambra told the jury that former soldier Peter Fuller saved his life when he intervened during the attack.
The court heard items associated with white supremacy and Nazism were found at Davies's home, including banners, swastika badges and Combat 18 stickers.
He also said he was ""absolutely fascinated"" with Islamic State and described the British man known as Jihadi John as his inspiration.
Gareth Preston, senior prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, described Davies as a ""dangerous young man whose distorted and racist views led him to commit a terrifying act of violence"".
He added: ""Such was the level of violence involved that, were it not for the extremely courageous actions of ex-serviceman Peter Fuller, this offence could have become an act of murder.""
Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking Fusilier Rigby to death.","Zack Davies, 26, targeted Dr Sarandev Bhambra at a Tesco store in Mold, Flintshire, in a racially motivated revenge assault for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Davies, of Mold, was found guilty of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 14 years.

During the attack, Davies used a machete and knife to inflict serious injuries on Dr Sarandev Bhambra. The prosecution argued that the motive for the attack was racial and was a response to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was killed by Islamist extremists in 2013.

The court heard that Davies had researched extremist material online and had chosen his victim solely based on his appearance. Dr Bhambra, who was 24 at the time of the attack, suffered deep cuts to his head and upper body, resulting in life-changing injuries.

The judge described the attack as a ""revenge mission"" and stated that Davies had been radicalized and motivated by hatred. He emphasized that such acts of violence have no place in society.

The case highlighted the continuing issue of racially motivated violence in the UK and the danger of radicalization. It also served as a reminder of the devastating impact such attacks can have on individuals and communities.

Efforts have been made to tackle extremism and hate crimes through initiatives such as the government's Prevent program, which aims to identify and support individuals vulnerable to radicalization. However, cases like Zack Davies' serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in combating this issue."
"Nicole Christie told a fatal accident inquiry she was preparing to teach a dance class at Liberton High School in Edinburgh when she heard a loud bang.
When she went to see what had happened, she saw Keane Wallis-Bennett's body lying underneath a modesty wall.
The 12-year-old died after the wall in the PE changing room collapsed in 2014.
Miss Christie, 26, said: ""I tried to move the wall off her but it was too heavy and so I called out for help.
""Some of the girls had to help us move the concrete. We couldn't get it off.""
Miss Christie was giving evidence on the fourth day of the inquiry.
The Crown Office said it was in the public interest to hold an inquiry to prevent such an incident from happening again.
On Friday, Miss Christie - who no longer teaches at Liberton High School - said that there was ""nothing out of the ordinary"" on 1 April 2014, the day Keane died.
She said she was set to teach a dance class before the wall collapsed on Keane.
Miss Christie said that one of her pupils did not have a leotard to take part in the dance class. She was going to get her one when the incident took place.
She told the court that she helped to get Keane's classmates out of the changing room and into a nearby hall.
Miss Christie said pupils were upset at what happened and she was in shock.
The inquiry had earlier heard that pupils had leaned on the wall to change their shoes when it collapsed on top of Keane.
She added: ""My first thought was I had to get them out.
""They were panicking. There was crying. They could hear the ambulance sirens.
""I couldn't tell them anything at that point and that's when the rumours started. One girl said she was leaning against the wall. I had to reassure her.""
Earlier the inquiry heard a number of statements which had been given by pupils to investigators following the incident.
In one statement, a girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said that she had told Miss Christie that she had seen the wall shaking before it had collapsed on Keane.
The schoolgirl told investigators that Miss Christie told her that it was fine and she did not have to worry.
When asked if she could remember being told that by the schoolgirl, Miss Christie said that the conversation never took place.
She added: ""There has been absolutely no pupil at school who told me about the wall being wobbly or anything like that.""
The inquiry will continue on Monday.","Nicole Christie told a fatal accident inquiry she was preparing to teach a dance class at Liberton High School in Edinburgh when she heard a loud bang.

Christie called for help and tried to support Keane until paramedics arrived. She described the incident as a tragic and horrifying event that left her deeply shaken. The inquiry aims to determine the circumstances surrounding the accident and prevent any similar incidents from occurring in the future."
"They are 43 points clear at the top of Division One and only need six points from this week's game against second-placed Middlesex to retain the title.
""We need a handful of points and we're set on doing it this week,"" bowler Steven Patterson told BBC Radio Leeds.
""We're on course for the record points total since it became two divisions.""
The County Championship was split in 2000 and the top-flight record is the 257 points that Sussex picked up in 2003, although Somerset collected 266 points when they won Division Two in 2007.
Yorkshire are on 241 points with three matches remaining and 31-year-old Patterson, who has taken 43 Championship wickets in 2015, thinks his side's winning run can continue beyond this season.
""If you see the team we've had and how many players we've missed then there seems to be no reason why we can't repeat it for the next three or four years,"" he added.
Despite their Championship success, Yorkshire's hopes of winning the One-Day Cup ended on Sunday when they suffered an eight-wicket loss to Gloucestershire in the semi-final at Headingley.","They are 43 points clear at the top of Division One and only need six points from this week's game against second-placed Middlesex to retain the title.

We have worked hard throughout the season and this match is the culmination of all our efforts."" The team is confident in their abilities and determined to finish the season on a high note. ""We have a strong squad and believe that we can get the job done,"" the captain added. The entire team is fully committed and motivated to deliver an outstanding performance."
"Jerry Nixon, a Microsoft development executive, said in a conference speech this week that Windows 10 would be the ""last version"" of the dominant desktop software.
His comments were echoed by Microsoft which said it would update Windows in future in an ""ongoing manner"".
Instead of new stand-alone versions, Windows 10 would be improved in regular instalments, the firm said.
Mr Nixon made his comments during Microsoft's Ignite conference held in Chicago this week.
In a statement, Microsoft said Mr Nixon's comments reflected a change in the way that it made its software.
""Windows will be delivered as a service bringing new innovations and updates in an ongoing manner,"" it said, adding that it expected there to be a ""long future"" for Windows.
The company said it had yet to decide on what to call the operating system beyond Windows 10.
""There will be no Windows 11,"" warned Steve Kleynhans, a research vice-president at analyst firm Gartner who monitors Microsoft.
He said Microsoft had in the past deliberately avoided using the name ""Windows 9"" and instead chose Windows 10 as a way to signify a break with a past which involved successive stand-alone versions of the operating system.
However, he said, working in that way had created many problems for Microsoft and its customers.
""Every three years or so Microsoft would sit down and create 'the next great OS',"" he said.
""The developers would be locked away and out would pop a product based on what the world wanted three years ago.""
Microsoft also had to spend a huge amount of money and marketing muscle to convince people that they needed this new version, and that it was better than anything that had come before, he explained.
Moving to a situation in which Windows is a constantly updated service will break out of this cycle, and let Microsoft tinker more with the software to test new features and see how customers like them, he added.
Most of the revenue generated by Windows for Microsoft came from sales of new PCs and this was unlikely to be affected by the change, Mr Kleynhans pointed out.
""Overall this is a positive step, but it does have some risks,"" he said.
""Microsoft will have to work hard to keep generating updates and new features, he said, adding that questions still remained about how corporate customers would adapt to the change and how Microsoft would provide support.
""It doesn't mean that Windows is frozen and will never move forward again,"" Mr Kleynhans told the BBC.
""Indeed we are about to see the opposite, with the speed of Windows updates shifting into high gear.""","Jerry Nixon, a Microsoft development executive, said in a conference speech this week that Windows 10 would be the ""last version"" of the dominant desktop software. His comments were echoed by Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, who said that Windows 10 was the ""last version of Windows.""

Nixon's statement suggests that Microsoft is moving away from the traditional model of releasing new versions of Windows every few years. Instead, they are transitioning to a more continuous update approach, similar to the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.

According to Nixon, this shift is due to several factors, including the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the need for a more responsive and agile software development process. Microsoft wants to provide a more seamless and consistent experience across different devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

Nadella further explained that instead of major releases, Microsoft would focus on delivering regular updates, enhancements, and new features to Windows 10 users. These updates would be delivered through Windows Update, ensuring that users stay up-to-date with the latest improvements.

The decision to move away from major new Windows releases also aligns with Microsoft's focus on its cloud-based services, such as Microsoft 365 and Azure. Microsoft aims to provide a unified and connected experience for users across multiple devices and platforms.

While this announcement might raise questions about the future of Windows, Microsoft remains committed to supporting and improving Windows 10 for the foreseeable future. Users can expect continuous updates and innovations, making Windows 10 a more dynamic and evolving operating system."
"The tweet, which appeared on the feed of Nick Harrington, who sits on Warwick District Council, contained offensive and racist language towards the Irish.
His account has since been deleted, but a screen grab of the tweet has been widely re-circulated, the Coventry Telegraph said.

"Over 70 countries attended the talks in Brussels, hosted by the EU.
Closing the meeting, European Commissioner for International Development Neven Mimica called the sum ""a remarkable, impressive amount"".
""Now is not the time to reduce our ambition or our investment in the people of Afghanistan,""  he added.
The amount pledged is only slightly less than the $4bn a year that the international community promised at the last Afghanistan conference in Tokyo in 2012.
Ahead of the meeting, the overseas countries were expected to pledge around $3bn in aid a year.
'We are helpless: Trapped by the Taliban in Kunduz
Afghanistan will be asked to do more to tackle corruption and to take back tens of thousands of failed asylum seekers.
The country faces a resurgent Taliban and remains reliant on foreign help, 15 years after the militants were ousted.
""We're buying four more years for Afghanistan,"" said EU special representative Franz-Michael Mellbin.
Who are the Taliban?
Last journey: The migrant who lost everything
US wasted millions on Afghan reconstruction, says watchdog
Battleground Kunduz: The city the Taliban seized
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani told the conference that Afghanistan was making progress on the economy, corruption and human rights but needed constructive international support to see the changes through.
""Afghans can make peace, we will make peace, we are committed to constructive politics, not destructive politics,"" he said.
US Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Taliban to make an ""honourable"" peace with Kabul.
He said the militant group should follow the example of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the notorious Afghan warlord designated a ""global terrorist"" by the US, who signed a peace deal with the Afghan government in September.
""This is a model for what might be possible,"" Mr Kerry added.
The EU is promising Afghanistan $1.5bn annually and has signed a deal for Kabul to take back Afghans who fail in their bid for asylum. Both sides deny the deal is a condition for new aid.
Afghans make up the second largest group of asylum seekers in Europe, after Syrians.
The BBC's Lyse Doucet in Brussels says recent Taliban advances on the battlefield will only harden the determination of many Afghans to seek a better life elsewhere.
""We are with you for the long run"" was the world's promise to Afghanistan in 2001. Aid still hasn't stopped.
That's partly because the same worries are still there. President Ghani has a vision for Afghanistan major donors can believe in.
But they - and Afghans - still need convincing it can be achieved by him in the Afghanistan of today.
For all the advances since 2001, there's rampant corruption, political infighting, and a battle against the Taliban taking a huge number of Afghan lives.
The unexpectedly high pledges seem to underline a recognition of the price Afghans, their neighbours, and the world beyond would pay if the Taliban gained ground, and Afghanistan sank into greater poverty and despair.
A record number of Afghans are already fleeing to Europe. This money is also meant to help create conditions to convince Afghans to stay, including the tens of thousands who will now be sent back under another deal struck in Brussels this week.
Taliban attacks this week on the cities of Kunduz in the north and Lashkar Gah in the south have underlined how fragile the security and development gains of recent years remain, despite all the money spent.
The United States and other international donors have pumped about $130bn into the country since 2002.
Efforts to rebuild after years of war began after US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power following the 9/11 attacks.
The figure is comparable to the Marshall Plan, a US initiative to rebuild a devastated Europe after World War Two, although the results have been much more limited.
Most of the money spent in Afghanistan has come from the US (about $115bn) - and official figures show that more than half of that was spent on security.
Nato pulled out combat forces in 2014 and the Taliban are now resurgent in many areas, prompting fears that hard-won, costly gains are at risk.
Fifteen years after the Taliban were toppled, Afghanistan still cannot survive without significant international support.
Despite all the money that's been poured in, it remains one of the poorest countries on earth, with 80% of its budget financed by aid.
The optimism of the early post-Taliban years - when new schools and hospitals were being built and Afghan refugees were returning - has been replaced in some quarters by donor fatigue and more and more questions about where the money will end up.
Major contributors are now indicating they expect to see greater Afghan success in tackling problems such as corruption and the lucrative narcotics trade, as well as progress on asylum seekers.
A more prosperous Afghanistan could mean fewer refugees in Europe - but hopes the country could become self-reliant one day seem many years away.
It is so serious that one of the main cities in the north, Kunduz, nearly fell to the militants again this week, a year after they briefly captured it in what was a major security embarrassment.
Afghan forces battled the Taliban for a third day in Kunduz on Wednesday, amid reports that food is running short and scores have fled the city.
Meanwhile in Kabul, a suicide bomber targeted a minibus carrying government officials, wounding four people, a day after a US soldier was killed by a bomb in the east.
In the southern province of Helmand, the Taliban have captured the administrative headquarters of Khan Nishin district, and are massed outside the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.
Government troops were reported to be resisting their advance there, and in parts of the central province of Uruzgan, where fighting has also broken out.","Over 70 countries attended the talks in Brussels, hosted by the EU.

"Hana Khan, 22 of Dollis Hill, north-west London, was convicted in February of two counts under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000 after supplying the money to 28-year-old Jafar Turay.
Mr Turay left the UK in July 2012 to join rebels fighting President Assad's regime.
At the Old Bailey, Khan was sentenced to 21 months, suspended for two years.
Mr Turay first travelled to Saudi Arabia and Egypt before crossing the border into Syria from Turkey in June 2013.
Judge Gerald Gordon said Khan's was an ""exceptional case"" because she had not been radicalised but had acted out of a misguided notion Turay was serious about making her his wife and setting up home in Turkey.
He said Khan was in ""marked contrast"" to other young women in the UK who have gone to join Jihadist fighters out of ""conviction"".
""You were blind to what should have been obvious - that fighting was the reason he was in Syria and at times in Turkey and Egypt also,"" he said.
Mr Turay, known as Joel Kelvin Daley before he converted to Islam, was wanted by police in connection with a serious assault before he fled the UK.
During the trial the jury heard that Khan and Mr Turay kept in touch via WhatsApp messaging.
The jury was also told Mr Turay sent pictures of children posing with weapons and of him posing with an AK-47 and heavy machine-guns.
In response, Khan told him: ""You look beautiful,"" the court heard.
But he later contacted her saying he was marrying someone else and the judge told her Mr Turay was ""cheating on you and lying to you for some time.""","Hana Khan, 22 of Dollis Hill, north-west London, was convicted in February of two counts under Section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000 after supplying the money to 28-year-old Jafar Ahmed, who was involved in terrorist activities. She was sentenced to five years in prison for her involvement in financing terrorism. The case came to light after an investigation by the Counter Terrorism Command of the Metropolitan Police.

The court heard that Hana Khan had transferred a significant amount of money to Jafar Ahmed, who used the funds to support extremist activities. The prosecution argued that Khan was fully aware of Ahmed's intentions and willingly provided the financial support.

During the trial, evidence was presented, including intercepted communications between Khan and Ahmed discussing the transfer of funds. The prosecution also presented financial records that showed Khan's involvement in the transactions.

The judge ruled that Khan's actions posed a serious threat to national security, as the money she provided could have been used to fund attacks or support extremist networks. In sentencing her, the judge emphasized the need to deter individuals from engaging in such activities and to protect society from the potential harm caused by terrorism.

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring and preventing the financing of terrorism. Financial transactions are often critical in enabling extremist activities, and authorities worldwide are committed to cracking down on individuals involved in such activities to safeguard national security."
"Mr Miliband wants British territories such as Bermuda to be internationally blacklisted if they do not compile public registers of offshore firms.
Bermuda's government said it had operated a central registry of companies since the 1940s.
Gibraltar says Labour was being ""unfair"" as it was subject to EU rules.
Mr Miliband has sent a letter to the leaders of the British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar and Montserrat. He also contacted the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
He said that - under a Labour government - they would have six months to compile a register or face being put on an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development list of ""tax havens"" list, incurring sanctions.
Bermuda premier Michael Dunkley said it remained open to dialogue with the UK.
A statement from Bermuda's government said it had noted Mr Miliband's comments, but insisted it was an international leader in the registration of companies.
Mr Dunkley said: ""The government of Bermuda remains open to continuing dialogue with the UK government, the UK opposition, and all other interested parties, in sharing best practice across borders in areas of corporate transparency, and the fight against fraud and crime.
""We would also remind Mr Miliband of Bermuda's strategic economic contribution to the UK, which includes direct and indirect employment in the UK of 100,000 people, as well as our role as a global hub for the reinsurance and insurance industries, providing the critical underwriting required for damage arising from natural disasters and terrorist events.""
Speaking on Sky News's Murnaghan programme, Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo, said:  ""The standards that apply in respect of financial services and their provision from Gibraltar are exactly the same standards that apply in respect of London, in respect of Frankfurt and the rest of the EU.
""Therefore it is quite unfair to characterise Gibraltar as a tax haven.""
The leader of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party added that ministers were adopting an anti-money laundering directive in September and it was ""very unlikely"" Gibraltar would find itself on the kind of list proposed by Labour.
Labour argues overseas territories and crown dependencies could help to stop or stem tax avoidance by showing tax authorities who is diverting money into companies there.
Chancellor George Osborne dismissed the Labour leader's plans saying he was ""unfit to be prime minister"" because he did not understand the current system.
Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Osborne said: ""If you actually look at what he's saying, he wants to blacklist every country of the OECD that doesn't have these central registers.
""Britain is leading by example, it is having new central registers, it is insisting that its overseas territories transparently share information with us.
""But the Labour leader is simply not fit for office because he does not think through the consequences of his anti-business, anti-enterprise and anti-our partners abroad policies.""
At the G8 summit in June 2013 the prime minster announced plans to tackle tax avoidance and has encouraged the UK's Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies to implement their own public central register.
So far none of the islands and outposts have followed the UK's lead, saying they will not make the change until there is international action.","Mr Miliband wants British territories such as Bermuda to be internationally blacklisted if they do not compile public registers of offshore firms. Bermuda's government said it had operated a central register of beneficial owners of companies for over 70 years, which can be accessed by law enforcement and tax authorities. It also stated that it had been compliant with international standards for transparency and anti-money laundering regulations.

However, Mr Miliband argues that Bermuda should adopt public registers to combat tax evasion and money laundering more effectively. He believes that public registers would provide greater transparency and accountability, making it harder for individuals and companies to hide their wealth and assets.

Bermuda's government, on the other hand, argues that public registers are unnecessary and potentially harmful to the privacy and competitiveness of its financial services industry. They believe that their existing system, which shares information with relevant authorities, is sufficient to address these concerns.

The debate between Mr Miliband and Bermuda's government highlights the ongoing global conversation about the need for greater transparency in offshore financial centers. While some argue that public registers are necessary to combat illicit financial activities, others are concerned about the potential impact on privacy and the competitiveness of these jurisdictions."
"Chief Constable David Crompton, of South Yorkshire Police, said motorway users and the emergency services would be endangered by the new arrangements.
Changes are planned between junctions 32 and 3 in South Yorkshire.
Robert Goodwill, roads minister, said the plan would ""boost the local economy and maintain or improve road safety"".
Under the scheme the motorway's hard shoulder would be converted to a permanent traffic lane. Similar schemes on other motorways operate only during particular times of heavy traffic.
Mr Crompton said he had sent a letter outlining his concerns to Mr Goodwill.
""At some point we believe these arrangements... will be a contributory factor in a serious accident or even someone dying"", he added.
Mr Crompton said under the scheme the emergency services could take longer to get to the scene of a crash and ""the hard shoulder is there for a very good reason"".
Mr Goodwill said: ""Existing smart motorway schemes have not only improved reliability and eased congestion, but have also improved safety - findings from the M42 pilot scheme showed that accidents more than halved with no fatal accidents in five years.
""After meeting with Meg Munn [Sheffield Heeley MP] and local police we are looking at ways we can further enhance safety, but the chief constable should carefully look at the evidence from existing smart motorway sections, which are already saving lives.""
The chief constable said the M1 scheme was not the same as one already in place on the M42 near Birmingham.
""What is proposed here has a lot less control of driver behaviour and it is much harder to regulate the flow of traffic.""
The section between Junction 32 (M18) and Junction 35 (A616) carries more than 110,000 vehicles each day and suffers from congestion and delay at peak times, according to the Highways Agency.
Construction is planned to start before 2015.
The agency said the M1 scheme would deliver benefits ""at a significantly lower cost than conventional motorway widening"".
The cost of the scheme is estimated to be up to Â£133m, it said.
Ms Munn had previously described the plan as ""a cheap way to widen the motorway"".","Chief Constable David Crompton, of South Yorkshire Police, said motorway users and the emergency services would be endangered by the new arrangements. Changes are planned between junctions 32 and 3 of the M1 motorway, where the hard shoulder will be converted into a permanent live lane to ease congestion. The proposed changes are part of the government's plan to upgrade the motorway network and improve traffic flow.

However, Chief Constable Crompton expressed concerns about the safety implications of this plan. He argued that removing the hard shoulder would limit space for emergency vehicles to respond to incidents, increasing response times and potentially endangering lives. He also stated that motorway users would be at higher risk as there would be no place for them to pull over in case of breakdowns or accidents.

The government defended the plan, stating that the removal of the hard shoulder would be accompanied by the installation of emergency refuge areas every 1.5 miles. These areas would serve as safe places for motorists to stop in case of emergencies. Furthermore, Highways England, the agency responsible for the motorway network, assured that extensive research and safety assessments have been conducted and that the changes would improve traffic flow without compromising safety.

The controversy surrounding the issue highlights the delicate balance between reducing congestion and ensuring road safety. While the new arrangements aim to alleviate traffic problems on the M1, concerns raised by Chief Constable Crompton underscore the importance of carefully considering all aspects of such changes to avoid potentially dangerous consequences."
"The 10-man home team will be without highly rated 18-year-old Sam Horsfield. The Florida-based player, who became the youngest Briton to qualify for the US Open earlier this year, withdrew last week citing ""personal reasons"".
Of the line-up that will compete for the amateur version of the Ryder Cup, only Ashley Chesters, Cormac Sharvin and Paul Dunne are higher than Horsfield in the world rankings.
""It was a great surprise and extremely disappointing,"" Edwards told BBC Sport before the contest against the United States, who will defend the famous trophy at Royal Lytham this weekend.
At his last meeting with Horsfield, Edwards was struck by the youngster's apparent enthusiasm for the contest. ""When I went to the US Amateur, all the talk was 'when are you announcing the team', then to be told he isn't coming is disappointing.""
Edwards says he received no elaboration on why the Manchester-born student decided to pull out. ""No, that's it - just personal reasons,"" he said. ""Very strange, yes. I can't add anything.""
However, the home skipper is convinced Horsfield's absence will not weaken his side's bid to wrest back the trophy they last won at Royal Aberdeen four years ago. ""We have a great replacement in Ewen Ferguson,"" he said.
""Ewen is a former British boys' champion, a winner twice this year in Scotland and part of the winning Scottish team at the European team championships.
""He will love the Walker Cup. It was a very tough phone call to make to him, actually, when I had to tell him originally he wasn't in the team.""
The Americans are favourites and boast a side that dominates the amateur standings. World number two Maverick McNealy, 19, is the highest ranked player in the match and one of six US players in the top 10.
That list also includes the recent US amateur champion Bryson DeChambeau, 21, who is also a National Collegiate Athletic Association individual champion. The team, captained by John 'Spider' Miller, features Jordan Niebrugge, who finished sixth at The Open earlier this year.
""Clearly they will have 10 good players but that just makes the challenge even greater and something more to relish,"" said Edwards. ""We will be inspired to perform against them.""
Great Britain and Ireland also boast a couple of players who excelled at St Andrews in July, with third-round leader Dunne and Chesters, who was 12th.
""I'm sure they will have learned a lot from those experiences,"" said Welshman Edwards, who leads the team for the third match running.
""The more used you are to playing in front of crowds, the easier it does become.
""I'm sure the other lads will feed off that and take great confidence from it.""

Dunne is one of a record five Irish players in the home team. ""These Irish lads have been together for some time now, playing boys' and men's golf for the last four or five years. One drags another along, don't they?"" Edwards said.
Inevitably, Walker Cup teams are also shaped by the churn of players turning professional. The Americans are without Oliver Schneiderjans, and amateur champion Bradley Neil gave up a likely place in the home team after deciding to join the paid ranks.
""I've no issue with anyone turning pro because of the rewards out there - but I do have an issue with the timing of some of them,"" said Edwards, who is director of coaching for England Golf.
""From my perspective with the England team, since the last Walker Cup we've had 20 either England squad or age squad players turn pro.
""It's a great shame, I don't think the players are appreciating the value of experience.
""You've only got to look at the very best players. OK some don't stay in amateur golf very long, but look at Tiger Woods - three US junior amateurs and three US amateurs. Who can argue with that?
""If you get used to winning that really helps your transition. The age of players turning pro in the last few years has gone down, I'm guessing, by a couple of years.
""The game has to do something because there's not enough room on the pro tours for them all to make a living.""
That said, Edwards is more pre-occupied with the forthcoming hostilities. As a player back in 2003, the Welshman completed a famous GB and I victory at Ganton.
Four years ago he skippered them to success over an American side that included Jordan Spieth, Harris English, Russell Henley and Peter Uihlein - and Edwards believes another victory is within the compass of his 2015 side.
""I've got a really good feeling about this team,"" he said. ""They've gelled really well, we are looking forward to getting going. We know the golf course.
""They all sense it, this is a great opportunity for them to create history and become not just a Walker Cup player but a Walker Cup player in a winning team.""","The 10-man home team will be without highly rated 18-year-old Sam Horsfield. The Florida-based player, who became the youngest Briton to qualify for the US Open earlier this year, withdrew from the tournament due to injury. Horsfield had been an exciting addition to the team and had been expected to perform well. His absence will be a blow to the home team's chances and they will have to rely on the remaining players to step up and fill the void."

"The Central Bureau of Investigation is expected to take over the inquiry into the Vyapam scandal from state police.
Vyapam is the Hindi acronym for an office that conducts examinations for government jobs and medical school admissions in the state.
The scandal involves thousands of arrests and many mysterious deaths.
Opposition parties have accused the BJP-ruled government in Madhya Pradesh of influencing the investigation and have been demanding a federal inquiry.
While ordering the inquiry, the Supreme Court judges criticised the Madhya Pradesh high court for refusing to take a decision on whether there should be a federal investigation into the scandal.
""Instead of taking a decision, the Madhya Pradesh high court washed its hands off [the case] and put the ball in our court,"" the judges were quoted as saying by the NDTV news channel.
The scandal involved leaking question papers, rigging answer sheets and hiring bright students as impersonators to sit for candidates, as well as selling medical school seats to the highest bidder. Anything between 1m rupees ($15,764; Â£10,168) and 7m rupees was paid for a seat, correspondents say.
Some 2,530 people have been accused in connection with the scandal since 2012.
Police have arrested about 1,980 people and 550 people are still being sought. Twenty courts in Madhya Pradesh are looking into 55 cases registered in connection with the scandal.
In a mysterious twist, some 33 people - mostly accused in connection with the scam - have died in the past two years, raising suspicions of foul play.  It is not clear how many deaths are linked to the scandal.","The Central Bureau of Investigation is expected to take over the inquiry into the Vyapam scandal from state police. Vyapam is the Hindi acronym for an office that conducts examinations for recruitment in government jobs and admission to professional courses in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The scandal came to light in 2013 when the irregularities and corruption in the recruitment process were exposed.

The state police initially handled the investigations into the Vyapam scam, but due to the widespread nature of the scandal and allegations of involvement of influential individuals, there have been demands for a more independent and impartial probe. As a result, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is the premier investigative agency in India, is expected to take over the inquiry.

The CBI is known for its expertise in conducting high-profile investigations and has the authority to pursue cases across state boundaries. Its involvement in the Vyapam case is expected to bring more transparency and credibility to the inquiry.

The Vyapam scandal has caused immense outrage in India as it not only involved corruption but also led to several mysterious deaths of people associated with the case. Many candidates who were affected by the irregularities in the recruitment process were denied job opportunities or admission to professional courses.

The CBI's takeover of the investigation is seen as a significant step towards ensuring fair and unbiased proceedings. It is hoped that with their intervention, all the culprits involved in the Vyapam scam, regardless of their influence or position, will be brought to justice."
"Glamorgan suffered their eighth Championship defeat against Leicestershire, losing by 26 runs following a batting collapse.
""The position in the league is disappointing but it's been encouraging [in terms of] where our next wave of players are coming from,"" Croft said.
""I'll take time to reflect on the season as a whole.""
He continued: ""We need to identify challenging areas, and work out formulas to eradicate that.""
Glamorgan had a chance to finish on a high after needing just 45 runs with six wickets in hand at Fischer County Ground, only to experience a familiar crash of wickets.
""Cricket's a game of technique and tactics, but that occasion was more a test of character,"" Croft said.
The former England spinner, who took control at the county as head coach in February, pointed to the emergence of young players as a cause for optimism going forward.
England under-19 batsman Aneurin Donald, still a teenager, has been joined by fellow batsmen Nick Selman (20) and Kiran Carlson (18), all-rounder Owen Morgan (22), and bowler Lukas Carey (19).
""Short term, it's been disappointing but for the middle and future it looks bright,"" Croft said.

""We have seen some really good contributions from our players throughout the season.""

Despite their struggles in the league, Glamorgan has had several standout performers in the Championship. Opener David Lloyd has been consistent with the bat, scoring three centuries and averaging over 40. Billy Root, brother of England's Joe Root, has also displayed his talent, scoring two centuries and averaging over 50.

""We have had some exceptional performances from individual players,"" Cooke acknowledged. ""David and Billy have been fantastic for us, and their contributions have been crucial in some of our victories.""

Cooke also highlighted the performances of the bowling unit, noting the impact of their experienced pacers. ""Our bowlers, specifically the likes of Michael Hogan and Timm van der Gugten, have delivered match-winning spells for us. They have been able to create pressure and take crucial wickets when needed.""

Despite the positives, Glamorgan has struggled to convert individual brilliance into team success. Cooke acknowledged the need for improvement in that regard. ""We need to find a way to perform collectively as a team. We have had instances where one or two players have done well, but the team as a whole has failed to support them consistently."""

"Captain Ian Bell made 98, aided by Jonathan Trott (70), Sam Hain (55) and Rikki Clarke's unbeaten 44 as the Bears reached 284-5 with 15 balls to spare.
Earlier, Yorkshire lost Adam Lyth to Keith Barker (2-39) to the first ball of the game before Joe Root scored 83.
Tim Bresnan made 65 and Matthew Waite 71 but the hosts, led by Grant Thornton (3-63), restricted Yorkshire to 281-8.
Yorkshire slip to second, replaced at the top of the North Group by Worcestershire, who beat Durham, but their 10 points from seven matches means they cannot now slip outside the top three.
One-Day Cup holders Warwickshire, who had previously won just once in seven group games, made the perfect start when Lyth was caught behind for a golden duck.
Jonny Bairstow fell to Clarke for eight and when England team-mate Root was fifth man out for a 98-ball 83, Yorkshire were 149-5.
But Bresnan and Waite shared a sixth-wicket stand of 116 to push the visitors to respectable total.
In reply, Trott and Hain put on 124 for the first wicket in 20 overs before Bell, fresh from his first century in 13 months against Worcestershire on Friday, hit a much more rapid 98 from 85 balls, including three sixes and 11 fours.
Despite Warwickshire's struggles, Bell has been in fine form in the One-Day Cup. He has passed 50 four times in eight games, having scored 51 against Notts, 93 at Derby and 104 at Worcester.
Clarke's 49-ball unbeaten 44 eased Warwickshire home to move off the bottom of the North Group in their final game.
Warwickshire spinner Jeetan Patel told BBC WM:
""We have come off a run of a few really bad losses and some that were quite tight but credit to the guys for the way they came out.
""We wanted to bowl well, field well and bat well and those three knocks from Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott and Sam Hain were fantastic.
""Keith Barker bowled 10 really good overs up front and got us two crucial wickets and then Rikki Clarke got that third one for us.
""Grant Thornton bowled really well which is where we need to get to. We are an ageing teams with a lot of experience but we need to be able to trust the younger guys.""
Yorkshire all-rounder Matthew Waite told BBC Radio Leeds:
""It was disappointing to lose but we are still in a good position. We have got Leicestershire on Tuesday so hopefully we can beat them at Headingley.
""I enjoyed my innings. It was just a shame we didn't win. But it was nice to get my first 50 for Yorkshire. I got 40 last week against Northants and that gave me a bit of confidence coming in.
""It's just nice to be in a side with six internationals and pleasing to know I that I can play in a side that good. Tim Bresnan has given me a lot of help.

"Andy's condition means he can never be left alone - and Jack has helped care for him since he was tiny.
Jack's local council provides support but research for the Children's Commissioner for England suggests that the vast majority of young carers are ""off the radar"".
This is ""absolutely unacceptable"", according to the Commissioner, Anne Longfield.
Andy has a deteriorating genetic condition which has forced him to use a wheelchair for the past four years.
Even going to the bathroom can put him at risk of a fall.
Jack stands in for his mother, Ruth, who is the primary carer, if she ever needs to go out.
""It's a matter of someone being here all the time. I rely heavily on Jack,"" explains Ruth.
Jack administers Andy's medication, prepares food and drink, helps him move around the flat and pushes his wheelchair when they go out.
He and his father have a very close relationship - but both parents fear their son has ""missed out on a normal upbringing"".
For the past year Jack has been part of a young carers project run by Hounslow Council in west London which provides crucial support.
""I go there after school sometimes. It's like a respite. You can go there and relax and talk to people who are in the same position as you,"" says Jack.
Local councils have a statutory duty to assess the needs of young carers, but many do not get the help they need, the study suggests.
The researchers asked every local authority in England for the numbers of young carers they support.
Of England's 153 local authorities, 118 provided data, revealing that they are supporting 28,000 young carers aged between five and 17.
But these figures are massively short of the 166,000 young carers identified in England by the 2011 Census.
Having adjusted the figures to account for not receiving data from 35 councils, the researchers calculate a shortfall of almost 133,000 or 80% of young carers.
""Not all children with caring responsibilities will need support from their council but it is vital that those who do are properly assessed and the right help put in place,"" said Ms Longfield.
""This report poses significant questions for local authorities about how they identify, assess and support young carers.
""It is absolutely unacceptable to have so many children with considerable caring responsibilities going under the radar, invisible to the authorities and denied the opportunities available to other children.""
The Local Government Association said councils across England were working hard to ensure that young carers are properly supported - but said this was ""proving increasingly difficult"", given funding cuts and rising pressure on children's services overall.
""The limited funding available has to be carefully targeted at those children and young people who are in the greatest need [and] unfortunately, this means that councils are forced to make increasingly difficult decisions,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board.
""However, it is important to be clear that young carers who aren't receiving support are not 'invisible' to authorities; all young carers should receive an assessment to establish whether support is needed, with new assessments undertaken if their circumstances change,"" said Mr Watts.
A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Young carers are this country's unsung heroes, selflessly providing support for the people they love, but their own needs can often be overlooked.
""That's why we changed the law to make sure young carers are identified and supported as early as possible, and councils are responsible for delivering this.
""Next year we will be publishing a strategy looking at the issues affecting these children and what more can be done to give them the help they need.""","Andy's condition means he can never be left alone - and Jack has helped care for him since he was tiny. Jack's local council provides support but research for the best options to supplement that support is ongoing. Jack wants to ensure Andy receives the best care possible, so he wants to explore different options and resources available to them.

1. Respite Care: Jack can inquire about respite care services offered by the local council or organizations catering to individuals with disabilities. Respite care provides temporary relief to primary caregivers, allowing them to have a break while ensuring continuous care for Andy.

2. Support Groups: Jack can join local support groups for caregivers of individuals with similar conditions. These groups can provide valuable information, emotional support, and share experiences and advice on coping strategies.

3. Home Modifications: Jack can research available grants or funding programs that cater to making necessary modifications to their home. These modifications can enhance Andy's safety, mobility, and accessibility, making it easier to care for him and ensure his well-being.

4. Assistive Technology: Investigating different types of assistive devices and technologies, such as alert systems, communication aids, or mobility aids, can significantly improve Andy's quality of life and alleviate some of the burdens associated with his condition.

5. Healthcare Professionals: Jack can reach out to healthcare professionals, such as therapists, social workers, or disability specialists, for guidance on available resources, therapies, or specialized care that could benefit Andy.

6. Financial Assistance: Investigate potential financial assistance programs or benefits that may be available to Andy and Jack. This could include disability benefits, grants, or tax credits specifically designed to support individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.

7. Caregiver Training: Jack may benefit from attending caregiver training programs or workshops to learn specific skills and techniques to handle Andy's condition effectively. These programs can provide practical knowledge and strategies for managing caregiving responsibilities.

8. Online Resources: Exploring reputable online resources, such as disability support websites, forums, or online communities, can provide Jack with additional information, guidance, and support networks outside his local area.

By researching these options, Jack can gauge the potential benefits and assess which resources align with Andy's unique needs. It is essential to continuously explore different avenues to ensure a comprehensive care plan and improve the overall well-being of both Andy and Jack."
"Du Plessis led the side to a series victory in Australia last month, as De Villiers sat out with an elbow injury.
De Villiers, 32, was expected to return for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka, but has not recovered in time.
""His decision to step down confirms his attitude to put the team first,"" said Cricket South Africa chief executive Haroon Lorgat.
""AB has always carried himself as a true team player.""
Wicketkeeper-batsman De Villiers, who has scored 8,074 runs in 106 Tests at an average of 50.46 since his debut in 2004, only captained the Proteas in two Tests after taking over from Hashim Amla during their series defeat by England in January.
He remains the one-day international captain, and is targeting a return ahead of the ODI leg of Sri Lanka's tour of South Africa in January.
""The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me,"" he said.

"RSPB Scotland said there had been a 15% rise since 2003, when the last survey took place, from 442 to 508 pairs.
The research was carried out by experts from the wildlife charity and the Scottish Raptor Study Group.
Scotland is now thought to be home to the UK's entire population of golden eagles.
England's only resident golden eagle, which occupied a site near Haweswater in the Lake District, has not been seen for more than a year and is feared dead.
The RSPB said the six-month survey - which the charity co-funded with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) - showed the raptor could now be defined as having a ""favourable conservation status"".
Numbers of golden eagles in Scotland reached very low numbers in the mid-19th Century, but have been steadily recovering since then.
Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said the birds were an ""awe-inspiring part of our natural heritage"" and welcomed the news from the survey.
""Across many parts of Scotland there's been a very welcome turnaround in how people respect these magnificent birds, part of a more enlightened public attitude towards birds of prey,"" he said.
""Increased monitoring and satellite tagging of eagles, as well as stronger sanctions against wildlife crime may be serving as effective deterrents against illegal activity, therefore helping their population to increase.
""However, the continued absence of golden eagles in some areas of eastern Scotland remains a real cause for concern and suggests that much more work needs to be done.""
The northern Highlands and the area between the Great Glen and Stirling saw the greatest increase in numbers between 2003 and 2015, when this latest survey was carried out.
Recovery also continues in much of the west Highlands and islands.
However, the population west of Inverness remained stable over the past 13 years rather than grew.
The RSPB said the reason behind the lack of recovery in that area was not clear, but pointed to persecution, recreation, forestry and poor weather as possible factors.
A decline in the number of animals that eagles eat because of grazing pressure from deer is thought to be another possible cause.
The survey also found golden eagles were not found at all in many parts of the eastern Highlands, with less than a third of these traditional ""home ranges"" occupied by a pair, despite being a ""very productive landscapes"" for these birds.
The RSPB blamed the raptor's absence from these areas on persecution and said four eagles fitted with satellite tags had been found illegally killed in the central and eastern Highlands between 2009 and 2013.
And in August, it emerged that eight golden eagles had vanished in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.
The RSPB claimed they had been illegally killed and their satellite tags destroyed, but the Scottish Moorland Group said there was no evidence to support this.
The Scottish government is carrying out a review into the disappearances, which it called ""disturbing and disappointing"".
Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham added: ""The golden eagle is a magnificent bird and it is extremely heartening to see a rise in the number of this iconic species in our skies. The successes have been down to partnership work and this is continuing with the South of Scotland Golden Eagle project, which aims to boost populations even further.
""But it is clear from this national survey that there are still areas of Scotland, which are ideal habitats for golden eagles to breed and hunt, where there has not been a recovery in population despite a lot of hard work to protect these birds. This seems like a missed opportunity.""
Andrew Bachell, SNH's director of policy and advice, said: ""It's wonderful to see golden eagles reaching favourable conservation status nationally. These beautiful birds are such an important part of Scotland's nature, a species which people love to see when they visit our wilder landscapes.
""It's particularly encouraging to see greater recovery in some areas where persecution had been thought to be a major constraint in the past. That picture is uneven though, and we would still expect eagles to be doing better in parts of the eastern Highlands.""
Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group at Scottish Land and Estates, said the increase in the golden eagle population was ""in large part"" a tribute to members of the group and the way they managed the land.
""They have helped the surveyors and worked with Scottish Natural Heritage in the interest of golden eagles for many years,"" he said.
""The east Highlands still have the highest level of productivity (young per pair) and a stable number of occupied territories over more than three decades.
""The south central Highlands, which includes significant areas of driven grouse moor has shown by far the greatest increase in range occupancy - 70% - since 2003.""","RSPB Scotland said there had been a 15% rise since 2003, when the last survey took place, from 442 to 508 pairs. The research was carried out by experts from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Scotland. RSPB is a UK charity that focuses on the conservation of birds and their habitats.

The experts from RSPB Scotland conducted the research to assess the population of breeding pairs of a particular bird species. They found that the number of breeding pairs had increased by 15% since the last survey in 2003. In 2003, there were 442 breeding pairs, and the recent survey revealed that the number had risen to 508 pairs.

This increase in breeding pairs is a positive sign, indicating a potential recovery for this particular bird species in Scotland. The experts from RSPB Scotland would have carried out comprehensive surveys and data collection to accurately determine the number of breeding pairs. Such surveys involve recording bird sightings, monitoring nesting sites, and analyzing population trends.

The RSPB Scotland's findings are significant as they can help inform conservation efforts and management strategies for the species. It suggests that conservation measures, such as habitat protection and management, may be having a positive impact on the population of the bird species in question.

Overall, the research carried out by the experts from RSPB Scotland demonstrates the importance of monitoring and studying bird populations to inform conservation actions and ensure the long-term sustainability of species and their habitats."

"The Morton captain has returned to training after four weeks out with an ankle knock ahead of the Scottish League Cup meeting with Aberdeen.
""I just started back training this week and played in a reserve game during the week there,"" said defender Kilday.
""I feel fit enough, but the boys have been playing well.""
Morton, who beat two other Premiership sides - Kilmarnock and Hamilton Academical - on the way to the last four, have won four of their last five games.
The latest was an eye-catching 5-0 hammering of Queen of the South in Dumfries that led to their opponents being knocked off the top of the Championship table.
""The boys were brilliant last week,"" said Kilday. ""They were magnificent - probably our best performance of the season.
""We're very confident, but we know Aberdeen are a very good team and it will be a hard game.
""We can't go to Hampden and defend for 90 minutes. We need to go out and play as well.
""Anything can happen because it's a one-off game.""
Morton will be without midfielder Ross Forbes, who is suspended after picking up two yellow cards, but Gavin Gunning is another vying for a return to the Greenock side's defence on Saturday after recovering from injury.
""Since I came to Morton, I've basically played every game - I've never really been injured,"" said 24-year-old Kilday, who signed after leaving Hamilton in 2014.
""This is the only time I've been injured and we are in a semi-final, so it would be very disappointing if I don't play, but it is the gaffer's decision and I can't really complain if I don't play.""
Kilday says his side's progress to their first semi-final since losing to Rangers in the Scottish Cup in 1981 has captured the imagination of the Greenock public and inspired the team.
""It's a big day for the club and the town,"" he said. ""I'm sure the fans will come in numbers, so it'll be a great day for them.
""Playing the games leading up to this game, everybody's buzzing, so obviously it's been good for the club, it's been good for the boys, it's given us something to look forward to and I think it's shown in our performances.
""It would mean a lot, being the captain, just to get to a final and play in a final.
""You wouldn't expect Morton to get to a final, so it's a once in a lifetime chance because we're not expected to get to the semi-final either.""
Kilday is fully aware of the threat posed by a Dons side sitting second top of the Premiership and picked out on-loan Norwich City midfielder James Maddison, along with attackers Jonny Hayes, Niall McGinn and Adam Rooney, as the major threat.
However, he suggested that Jim Duffy's side had their own match winner in Jai Quitongo, the 19-year-old former Aberdeen winger who has attracted interest from a number of English clubs.
""His pace, his power can cause them problems,"" added his captain. ""Against Hamilton and Kilmarnock, he did really well, so I think he'll be a big threat to Aberdeen.
""Obviously it's his old club as well, so he'll want to show them what they're missing.
""He's really looking forward to it - he's a confident boy anyway, so I don't think he'll be too nervous and he doesn't let the speculation affect him.""","The Morton captain has returned to training after four weeks out with an ankle knock ahead of the Scottish League Cup meeting with Aberdeen. ""I just started back training this week and it feels good to be back with the team,"" said the Morton captain. ""It was frustrating to be out for so long, but I've been working hard with the medical staff to get back to full fitness. The ankle feels strong now, and I'm confident that I'll be ready for the match against Aberdeen.

"Police said an officer was killed in a car-ramming attack in Umm al-Hiran, in the Negev desert, and that the Israeli Arab driver of the car was shot dead.
They alleged he was active in an Islamist group and might have been influenced by so-called Islamic State.
But locals said he just lost control of his car after being shot by police.
The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says tensions are running high in the area.
There have been many house demolitions in Umm al-Hiran as a new, mainly Jewish town is built on the site.
The Israeli Supreme Court has rejected an argument that members of a local Bedouin tribe have rights to the land.
The army moved them to Umm al-Hiran from their original village in the 1950s, a few years after the State of Israel was created. They have now been told to move to new housing elsewhere.
Police spokesman Supt Micky Rosenfeld said a local man had driven at speed towards officers deployed during an operation to demolish 15 structures deemed to have been built without a permit on state land.
""A vehicle driven by a terrorist from the Islamic Movement intended to strike a number of officers and carry out an attack,"" he said in a statement. ""The officers responded and the terrorist was neutralised.""
The Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement was outlawed in November 2015, after the Israeli government accused it of fomenting a wave of knife, gun and vehicle-ramming attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs that has killed at least 42 people in the past 16 months.
The movement's Southern Branch, which recognises Israel's legitimacy and engages in national politics, has not been banned.
Supt Rosenfeld said the officer who died was 34-year-old Sgt Maj Erez Levi.
The driver was meanwhile named as Yaakub Abu al-Qiyan.
Village activist Raed Abu al-Qiyan said he was a member of his Bedouin tribe and owned one of the structures that had been scheduled for demolition.
""The Israeli narrative is a lie. He was a revered school teacher,"" he told AFP news agency. ""He has no relations with the Islamic Movement.""
Human rights activist Michal Haramati said Mr Abu al-Qiyan had not been driving towards police when he was shot.
""Suddenly the car started to go down the hill, without control, absolutely,"" she told Reuters news agency. ""The driver was obviously dead by the time that he lost control this way. That's when he hit the cops.""
The driver's brother, Ahmad Abu al-Qiyan, said he was ""murdered in cold blood"".
The police later released aerial video footage filmed by a helicopter. A spokesman said it showed Mr Abu al-Qiyan had accelerated as he drove towards Sgt Levi.
However, Israeli media said the video also appeared to show other officers walking towards the vehicle and opening fire before it increased speed.
Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan wrote on Twitter that the officers had called on the vehicle to stop and fired warning shots into the air, only aiming at the vehicle when it continued moving.
Following Wednesday's incident, there were further clashes in Umm al-Hiran in which several other police officers were wounded, Supt Rosenfeld said.
Locals accused them of using excessive force to remove protesters.
Politician Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Joint List in the Israeli parliament, was wounded during the clashes and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to ""enflame the area"".
Mr Erdan accused Mr Odeh of travelling to Umm al-Hiran to ""incite violence"" and warned there might be ""criminal implications for him"".","Police said an officer was killed in a car-ramming attack in Umm al-Hiran, in the Negev desert, and that the Israeli Arab driver of the car was shot dead. They are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. The incident occurred during clashes between Israeli police and Bedouin residents of Umm al-Hiran, who were protesting against the demolition of their homes. The Israeli authorities claim that the driver deliberately rammed his vehicle into police officers, killing one, before he was shot dead. However, witnesses and community members have disputed this narrative, suggesting that the driver lost control of his vehicle due to the heavy police presence. The incident has sparked renewed tensions and raised concerns regarding the treatment of Israel's Arab minority."
"It is a steep climb from the current 17% and Andrew Mackenzie described it as an ""aspirational goal"".
The Anglo-Australian mining company is holding its annual general meeting in London, almost a year on from the fatal Samarco dam collapse in Brazil.
Protest groups have been calling on BHP to do more to make up for the damage.
Nineteen people were killed and hundreds were left homeless last November when the Fundao dam, owned by Samarco - a joint venture between BHP and the Brazilian firm Vale - collapsed.
The dam burst released billions of gallons of sludge, causing significant environmental damage.
The protesters want BHP to expand its compensation scheme and to cancel its plans to build another dam in the area.
When it comes to chief executive Andrew Mackenzie's aim of have a 50-50 balance between men and women, he says there is not just a moral imperative to change, but a commercial one as well.
""We will harness the enormous potential that a more inclusive and diverse workplace can deliver,"" he says.
BHP argues that the commercial case for action is compelling: more inclusive and diverse workplaces perform better and have a better safety record.
However, mining has one of the lowest percentages of women in its workforce when compared to other sectors.
Currently, only 17% of those at BHP Billiton are women, which is in line with the industry average for mining firms, explains Jackie Woods of Australia's Workplace Gender Equality Agency.
""In the end, though, even an aspirational target is still a terrific thing,"" she says.
""It is a public show of support and intention to improve gender equality.""
BHP's Mr Mackenzie makes it clear that new initiatives will be needed to boost the numbers of women it employs.
""While we have made progress, we still aren't as inclusive or diverse as we could be,"" he says.
""Without new initiatives, it would take us 30 years just to get to 30% female representation.""
In a blue-collar industry, even simple things such as shift patterns can help in breaking down barriers, says Jackie Woods.
""In many cases, women still do the caring and domestic work.
""So measures like changing shift structures from 12 hours to eight hours or introducing split shifts will make it easier for women to enter such gender-segregated industries.""
The agency says companies need to take a realistic long term approach.
A first stumbling block to any rapid changes might be that there are simply not enough trained women available for the jobs on offer.
In many cases, it's an issue that in fact has to be addressed much earlier on, in schools and universities, says Ms Woods - by setting student intake targets so that more women can access training for industries traditionally dominated by men.
BHP says it has included the the goal of inclusive and diverse teams in its charter and, says Mr Mackenzie, this will now be ""a key measure of performance"".","It is a steep climb from the current 17% and Andrew Mackenzie described it as an ""aspirational goal"". The Anglo-Australian mining company is holding its annual general meeting in London, where CEO Andrew Mackenzie discussed the company's plans to increase the proportion of women in its workforce to 50% by 2030. Currently, women make up only 17% of the company's workforce.

Mackenzie acknowledged that achieving this goal would be a significant challenge, but emphasized the importance of diversity and inclusion in the mining industry. He stated that having a more diverse workforce would lead to better decision-making and ultimately improve the company's performance.

To reach this target, BHP plans to invest around $10 billion over the next five years to increase the number of women in its workforce. This investment will include initiatives to boost female representation at all levels of the company, from entry-level roles to board positions.

In addition to increasing female representation, BHP also aims to improve gender balance in its supply chain and boost the number of women-owned businesses it works with.

During the meeting, Mackenzie faced questions about the company's progress on gender diversity and pay equity. He acknowledged that there is still work to be done in these areas but assured shareholders that BHP is committed to addressing these issues.

While some shareholders praised BHP's commitment to diversity, others expressed skepticism about the feasibility of achieving a 50% female workforce within the set timeframe. Mackenzie acknowledged the challenges but remained optimistic, stating that BHP is determined to create lasting change in the mining industry.

Overall, BHP's goal of achieving gender parity by 2030 reflects the growing emphasis on diversity and inclusion in the corporate world. It demonstrates the company's commitment to creating a more equal and representative workforce in the traditionally male-dominated mining industry."
"The park boundaries have grown within touching distance either side of the M6 motorway, creating a band of protected land across the north west of England.
Originally designated in the 1950s, the expansion of the borders aims to boost rural tourism.
The Yorkshire Dales has grown in size by 24%, with the Lakes increasing 3%.
The move, announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in October, sees the Dales stretch to the north and west and the Lakes to the east and south.
Most of the Yorkshire Dales park is in North Yorkshire, but 28% of its land is now in Cumbria and 1% in Lancashire.
Despite the change in geography the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority said the government had no plans to change the park's name, which was written on a designation order in 1954.
Lake District
Yorkshire Dales
Natural England first suggested the extensions in 2009, with a public inquiry launched in 2013.
After hearing more than 3,000 objections and representations, it was recommended the extensions be approved.
Mark Corner, from the Yorkshire Dales Society, said: ""We're very excited, we have been working on this for many years and campaigned and lobbied wherever we can.
""Some of the boundaries were picked on an arbitrary basis in the 1950s, so to join it up makes an awful lot of sense. It now should be on everyone's bucket list.""
The Friends of the Lake District charity said it was ""a historic and very rare day"".
Policy officer Alison Lax said: ""These areas have always been special and valued in Cumbria, but now it adds a level of national recognition.
""It's unfinished business, as they really should have been part of the parks in the first place. The landscape's qualities are on a par with everything that was included in the parks previously.""
The combined area of parks makes it the largest area of national park land in England, the charity said.
John Welbank, who runs a planning consultancy for rural businesses, said the move was a boost for tourism but would have a ""negative impact on new start-ups"".
""When they try and develop businesses and property, most people's attitudes will change drastically as they won't realise the planning implications until they come up against it,"" he said.
""There are implications for business development projects as it will become significantly harder.""

In the Yorkshire Dales, the extension means the number of farms in the national park has gone up 32% to 1090.
When the extension was announced, the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) criticised the move, saying it ignored the views of farmers and landowners.
Greg Stephenson, from Hipping Hall hotel, Cowan Bridge, described the business now being inside a national park ""a good thing"".
He said: ""Leck and Cowan Bridge have been overlooked by visitors because it's a beautiful area, but sits on the fringes between the old borders of the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales.
""It will now become part of a distinct area which is recognised internationally.""
On the topic of a small corner of Lancashire gaining a Yorkshire title, he said: ""I'm sure there will be a few people around here who have a tongue-in-cheek moment, but I think most will be happy to be part of this well-established brand.""
In the spirit of the age, and after much thought, I have now decided to start a petition to rename the Dales National Park (can't bring myself to use the Y word) as the 'Northern Powerhouse Park of the People'.
The powers that be have tried in vain for over a number of decades to rename parts of the Red Rose county.
I can only imagine the area to be added to the national park must be of a far superior standard to any of the current acres.
I have enlisted the help of a stout Red Rose fellowship and we march at dawn to dig the ditch and erect the fence to beat back the advance of our meddling eastern cousins.
Stephen Lowe, Lancashire Outdoors presenter for BBC Radio Lancashire","The park boundaries have grown within touching distance either side of the M6 motorway, creating a band of protected land across the north west of England. Originally designated in the 1951, the park now covers approximately 3,500 square kilometers. It spans across parts of Cumbria, Lancashire, and North Yorkshire, encompassing a diverse range of landscapes including lakes, forests, hills, and moorlands.

The Lake District National Park attracts millions of visitors each year due to its outstanding natural beauty and recreational opportunities. It is home to England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike, as well as its deepest lake, Wastwater. The park also features sixteen major lakes, including Windermere, Ullswater, and Derwentwater, which offer opportunities for boating, kayaking, and sailing.

The park is renowned for its picturesque villages and towns, such as Ambleside, Keswick, and Grasmere, which have inspired numerous poets, writers, and artists throughout history. It has a rich cultural heritage, with historic sites like Castlerigg Stone Circle and medieval castles located within its boundaries.

In addition to its natural and cultural attractions, the Lake District National Park provides ample opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and wildlife spotting. It is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including several rare and protected species.

The park is carefully managed to balance conservation and sustainable tourism. Various organizations and initiatives work together to protect the area's natural resources, habitats, and wildlife. The park also promotes sustainable tourism practices and offers educational programs to raise awareness about the importance of preserving the environment.

Overall, the Lake District National Park is a cherished and protected area in the north west of England, offering visitors and locals alike a place of natural beauty, outdoor adventures, and cultural significance."
"Four goals in 18 second-half minutes from Roddy MacDonald swung a previously tight tie the way of the Tighnabruaich side.
With just three minutes on the clock in Oban, Colin MacDonald fired Kyles ahead and gave them the lead again after Glen MacKintosh equalised. Fraser MacKintosh just beat the half-time whistle with More's second equaliser and Sandy MacKenzie got Kyles' third soon after the restart.
The hour marked the start of MacDonald's goal rush which took Kyles to 5-2 before Glen MacKintosh pulled one back and MacDonald responded with two more. MacKintosh immediately completed his hat-trick to round off an 11-goal final matched only by Oban Camanachd's 8-3 victory 60 years previously.
Kyles' success, however, came at the expense of losing top spot in the Marine Harvest Premiership after Kinlochshiel took a two-point lead with a 5-1 defeat of bottom side Glasgow Mid Argyll.
Once again MacRaes scored all five of the Kinlochshiel goals which put them two points clear of Kyles in the Premiership but with an extra game played. In a fixture switched to neutral Inverness, Keith MacRae scored a hat-trick while Oliver was on target in the first half and John in the second. Calum McLay responded for Mid Argyll at 3-0.
Glenurquhart's relegation concerns deepened after they lost 3-2 at home to Oban Camanachd. The National Division title became an almost certain two-horse race between leaders Skye and Caberfeidh after they disposed of their two nearest challengers. The island side beat Fort William 4-0 while it was 5-2 for Cabers over Inveraray.
Malcolm Clark got an early goal for Oban Camanachd and Paul MacKintosh equalised late in the first half. Strikes midway through the second from Daniel Cameron and Willie Neilson swung the game firmly in Camanachd's direction before Daniel MacKintosh got one back for Glen late on.
With two to go down, Mid Argyll have five points and Kilmallie, whose game was postponed, have seven, both with four matches to play. Glenurquhart and Lochaber have eight and nine points respectively, but both with only two matches left.
In the National Division, an early goal from Iain MacLellan and a late one from Jordan Murchison bracketed a James Pringle double for Skye without response from Fort William in Portree.
At Strathpeffer, Craig Morrison's hat trick after Colin MacLennan's first minute opener laid the foundations of Cabers' victory. Graham Bartlett was Cabers' other scorer in a game where Inveraray's response came from two Fraser Watt penalties.
Skye remain three points clear of Caberfeidh in the promotion places while Fort and Inveraray, albeit with two games in hand, are a further seven points adrift making the top two look virtually unassailable.","Four goals in 18 second-half minutes from Roddy MacDonald swung a previously tight tie the way of the Tighnabruaich side. With just three minutes on the clock in Oban, Colin Smith opened the scoring for the home team with a well-taken strike from outside the box. The crowd erupted in celebration as it seemed that Oban would be on their way to victory.

However, Tighnabruaich had other ideas. MacDonald, who had been relatively quiet in the first half, suddenly came to life. He found himself in the right place at the right time to tap in an equalizer in the 55th minute. This goal seemed to give his team a much-needed boost of confidence.

Just three minutes later, MacDonald struck again. This time, he unleashed a powerful shot from the edge of the area that left the Oban goalkeeper with no chance. Tighnabruaich's supporters could barely believe their luck as their team took the lead.

But MacDonald was not done yet. In the 65th minute, he completed his hat-trick with a stunning solo effort. He weaved through the Oban defense, leaving defenders in his wake, before calmly slotting the ball into the bottom corner of the net. The Oban players could only watch in disbelief as MacDonald celebrated with his teammates.

As if that wasn't enough, MacDonald added insult to injury in the 73rd minute by scoring his fourth and final goal of the game. Tighnabruaich's fans were in delirium as their team ran riot.

Oban tried desperately to mount a comeback, but it was too late. Tighnabruaich held firm and secured a memorable victory. The final whistle blew, and the players embraced each other in celebration.

Roddy MacDonald's stellar performance will surely go down in Tighnabruaich's history. His four goals in 18 minutes turned the game on its head and ensured his team's success. Oban, on the other hand, will be left to wonder how they let such a tight tie slip away."
"NHS Improvement says prescriptions for all types of antibiotic were down by more than 2.6 million on the previous year to about 34 million in 2015-16.
They say it is a ""fantastic result"" and shows doctors are being careful not to over-prescribe them.
It is part of a wider drive to stop harmful infections developing resistance to antibiotics.
In the UK, the largest chunk of antibiotic prescribing - 80% - occurs outside of hospital.
And half of these prescriptions are to treat chest infections.
Antibiotics only work for bacterial infections.
There is no point in giving them if the cause of illness is a virus, such as the flu.
34 million
antibiotics prescribed by GPs in England in financial year 2015-16
2.7 million fewer antibiotics given by doctors compared to previous year, a 7.3% reduction
80% of antibiotic prescribing occurs outside of hospital
50,000 lives lost annually to antibiotic-resistant infections in Europe and the US
The government has offered a financial incentive to get GPs to cut down on their prescribing.
Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) get a Quality Premium payment if family doctors hit the target.
The figures are impressive. But that should come as no surprise. There have been growing concerns about the use of antibiotics as the report last week by Lord Jim O'Neill demonstrated.
But this success is also down to money. GPs have been paid to reduce their use of antibiotics.
Local health bosses were given extra money by NHS England to get prescribing down and they have used this to incentivise doctors. Different arrangements were made in different areas, but some GP practices received in excess of Â£20,000 for hitting the targets. Next year the targets have been extended to 4% for overall use and 20% for broad spectrum antibiotics.
In the NHS money, it seems, talks - but if it helps tackle what experts have described as a ""greater threat than cancer"" nobody will be complaining.
Reducing unnecessary prescribing saves the NHS money in drug costs.
The figures show GPs have overshot the targets.
The target reduction for all types of antibiotic had been set at 1%, but the actual reduction was about 7%.
Prescriptions for broad-spectrum antibiotics - drugs that should be reserved for tackling the most serious, hard-to-treat bacterial infections - went down by 16%, from 3.9 million prescriptions in 2014-15 to 3.3 million the following year.
The target had been a 10% reduction.
Dr Mike Durkin, from NHS Improvement, said: ""This [is a] fantastic result achieved in just one year.""
He said they would continue to work to bring the figures down further.
""Every year, too many people suffer and lose their lives due to antibiotic-resistant infections,"" he said.
""At a time when the NHS has advanced in many areas of patient care, science and technology, we must work to prevent healthcare going backwards to a time where antibiotics are no longer fighting infections.
""This is why efforts in the NHS to reduce the overprescribing of antibiotics are crucial, and these latest figures are a significant step forward in this fight.""
Dr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors faced pressure from patients to prescribe antibiotics, but that it was their duty to say no sometimes.
""We need to continue to work together to make the public realise that prescribing antibiotics is not always the answer to treating minor, self-limiting illness,"" she said.","NHS Improvement says prescriptions for all types of antibiotic were down by more than 2.6 million on the previous year to about 34 million in 2015-16. They say it is a positive sign that efforts to reduce antibiotic prescribing are working. This decline in prescriptions is important as it helps in tackling the problem of antibiotic resistance, which occurs when bacteria become resistant to the drugs used to treat them. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics contribute to this growing issue.

The decrease in antibiotic prescriptions suggests that healthcare professionals are becoming more cautious in their prescribing practices. It shows that they are being more selective in using antibiotics when necessary, rather than prescribing them for minor infections or conditions where they may not be effective.

Efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of antibiotic resistance and promote responsible antibiotic use have been ongoing for several years. These initiatives aim to educate both healthcare professionals and the general public about the importance of using antibiotics judiciously.

However, it is essential to continue these efforts as antibiotic resistance remains a significant global concern. Continued education, research, and the development of new antibiotics are necessary to combat this problem effectively. Additionally, it is crucial for individuals to follow healthcare professionals' advice and complete their prescribed antibiotic courses to ensure optimal treatment and reduce the risk of resistance.

Overall, the decrease in antibiotic prescriptions is a positive step in the fight against antibiotic resistance, but further efforts are needed to encourage responsible antibiotic use and preserve these life-saving drugs for future generations."
"This is according to a study of the performance of chimpanzees in a test called the ""ultimatum game"".
Traditionally, the game is employed as a test of economics; two people decide how to divide a sum of money.
This modified game, in which two chimps decided how to divide a portion of banana slices, seems to have revealed the primates' generous side.
The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was part of an effort to uncover the evolutionary routes of why we share, even when it does not make economic sense.
Scientists say this innate fairness is an important foundation of co-operative societies like ours.
Lead researcher Darby Proctor from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University, US, explained why she and her colleagues chose to use the ultimatum game, which has been used in the past to illustrate the human tendency to share.
During the game, one participant is given an amount of money and asked to ""make an offer"" to the second player. If that second player accepts the offer, the money is divided accordingly.
But, if the second player refuses that offer, both players receive nothing. This is the basis of the fairness versus economics quandary; if the first player proposes a selfish, unequal offer, the affronted recipient might refuse.
And this is exactly what happens in humans. Although it makes economic sense to give away as little as possible and accept any offer that's proposed, people usually make roughly equal, or ""fair"" offers, and tend to refuse unequal or ""unfair"" offers.
Dr Proctor and her colleagues trained their chimp participants to play a similar game, using coloured tokens to represent a reward.
""We tried to abstract it a little - to make it a bit like money,"" Dr Proctor explained.
Discover how chimpanzees communicate
""We trained them with two different tokens.
""If they took [a white token], they would be able to split the food equally, and taking the other [blue] token meant that the first chimp would get more food than the partner.""
The researchers presented both tokens to the first chimp, which would then choose one and offer it to its partner.
As with the human version of the game, if the partner accepted the token, both animals received their reward.
Three pairs of chimps played this game, and the results revealed that the animals had a tendency to offer a fair and equal share of the food reward.
In another experiment, the team repeated the test with 20 children between the ages of two and seven. They discovered that both young children and chimps ""responded like humans typically do"" - tending to opt for an equal division of the prize.
""What we're trying to get at is the evolutionary route of why humans share,"" explained Dr Proctor.
""Both chimps and people are hugely cooperative; they engage in cooperative hunting, they share food, they care for each other's offspring.
""So it's likely that this [fairness] was needed in the evolution of cooperation.
""It seems to me that the human sense of fairness has been around in primates for at least as long as humans and chimps have been separated.""
Dr Susanne Schultz from the University of Manchester said the study was very interesting and showed ""the potential for chimps to be aware of fair offers"".
""It is interesting that changing the study design - primarily by not using food rewards it seems - one can elicit fairness behaviour in chimps,"" she told the BBC.
She added though that is was not clear that the chimps completely understood the design of the game and that, with just six chimps involved in the study, further evidence would be needed to show clearly that chimps had a natural tendency towards fairness.","This is according to a study of the performance of chimpanzees in a test called the ""ultimatum game"". Traditionally, the game is employed as a test of economics; two people (or in this case, chimpanzees) are given a sum of money and are asked to divide it between themselves. One person proposes a division, and the other person can either accept the offer or reject it. If the offer is accepted, both players receive the proposed amount. If it is rejected, both players receive nothing.

In this study, the researchers modified the ultimatum game to be played by chimpanzees. The chimps were paired up and given tokens instead of money. They were then placed in separate enclosures with a mesh barrier between them, preventing direct physical interaction. Each chimp could see what the other chimp was doing, but they could not communicate with each other.

The chimps were trained to understand the concept of the game and were familiarized with the tokens as a form of currency. They were also given a set of food rewards that they could exchange for tokens, creating a sense of value for the tokens.

During the game, one chimp would propose a division of tokens by pushing them through a slot in the mesh barrier. The other chimp could then either accept the offer by pulling the tokens through the barrier, or reject it by leaving them untouched. If the offer was accepted, both chimps would receive the proposed amount of tokens. If it was rejected, both chimps would receive nothing.

The results of the study showed that the chimps displayed a high level of fairness in their behavior. When offered an equal split of tokens, the majority of chimps accepted the offer. However, when offered an unequal split, many chimps rejected the offer, even if it meant receiving nothing.

These findings suggest that chimpanzees have a sense of fairness and will reject unfair offers, even if it means sacrificing a reward. This demonstrates a level of economic decision-making and social behavior similar to that observed in humans. The study has significant implications for understanding the evolutionary origins of fairness and reciprocal behavior in primates."
"The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the EU was worth £12.9bn to Scotland's exporters.
Chief executive Liz Cameron warned that the UK economy remained vulnerable to external shocks.
She was speaking as the Conservatives sealed election victory.
The party has already undertaken to hold a referendum on membership of the EU during the next parliament.
Ms Cameron said: ""It is now vital that the business of government resumes quickly.
""Our economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as the continuing Greek bailout saga and a slowdown in a number of our international target markets.
""What we don't need is extended uncertainty over our future membership of the European Union.""
She added: ""This market is worth £12.9bn to Scotland's exporters and the European question needs to be settled quickly and decisively.
""Here in Scotland, the election has produced a very different result to the rest of the UK, but business and our economy should remain the central driver.
""That is our message to all Scottish MPs. Let's grasp the opportunity and ensure that our politicians work more closely together as they embark on the implementation of additional devolved powers to the Scottish Parliament.""
Business organisation CBI Scotland said the election result had been decisive north of the border and that firms would now be looking for devolution proposals, agreed by all parties in the draft Scotland Bill, to feature in the Queen's Speech.
Director Hugh Aitken added: ""Businesses will want to see the SNP keep its focus on policies that help make Scotland more competitive, like building more new homes, keeping the UK in a reformed EU and extending the Annual Investment Allowance.
""Getting the deficit down must be a priority, to maintain the UK's credibility in international markets which will keep the cost of borrowing down for growing Scottish businesses.""
The Federation of Small Businesses congratulated the SNP on what it called ""a truly stunning result"", after the party won 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland.
Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: ""No matter the scale of the political sea-change, though, the big issues facing the class of 2015 remain the same: sorting out the economy, securing the recovery and backing business to create jobs and raise revenues.
""On a UK level, the fact that we have a clear winner means we are spared the threatened weeks of political wrangling and horse-trading.
""That means the new government can get straight on with delivering on the issues that matter most to Scotland's small businesses: ending the scandal of late payment; developing a more competitive banking market; and ensuring that big energy firms treat our members fairly.""","The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the EU was worth £12.9bn to Scotland's exporters. Chief executive Liz Cameron warned that the UK economy remained vulnerable to external shocks. She was speaking in response to the Scottish government's publication of a report on the benefits of EU membership for Scotland's economy. Cameron emphasized that the EU market played a vital role in supporting Scotland's exports and that leaving the EU would present significant risks and challenges.

Cameron also expressed concern about the potential impact of external shocks on the UK economy. She highlighted the importance of maintaining strong international trading relationships and access to markets for Scottish businesses to mitigate these risks.

The Scottish Chambers of Commerce further argued that the positive economic impact of EU membership was not limited to exports. They believed that EU membership also supported investment, innovation, and job creation in Scotland. Therefore, they urged the government to carefully consider the implications of leaving the EU and to prioritize the interests of Scottish businesses and the economy in the decision-making process.

Overall, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce emphasized the value of the EU to Scotland's exporters and the potential risks associated with leaving the Union. She suggested that maintaining access to the EU market was crucial for the future growth and prosperity of Scottish businesses."
"Larry Flanagan criticised how some journalists and politicians ""portray a problem as a crisis"".
He told the EIS annual meeting in Perth a ""more considered analysis"" would be useful.
Mr Flanagan spoke as delegates confirmed they may take industrial action unless their pay improves.
The union's general secretary said some teachers were fearful that in the run-up to next year's Scottish election, politicians may seek to overplay concerns to score political advantage.
Mr Flanagan said there were also misgivings about the way some popular newspapers covered education, believing they sensationalised problems but did not reflect the reality of the situation in many schools and classrooms.
Addressing delegates, Mr Flanagan said: ""It has been interesting to read recently some right-wing commentators having a specific go at the EIS, with one demanding that the first minister should 'take on the EIS'. But on what basis?
""The inference which might be drawn from these comments is that somehow the EIS is the block to 'progress' however that is defined - when the reality is that as Scotland's teachers, we are the vehicle of progress.""
Mr Flanagan said no-one was suggesting ""that everything in Scottish education is perfect - clearly it isn't"".
But he said the union was ""well aware of the attainment gap"" and was working jointly with the Scottish government on issues regarding child poverty.
A motion calling for a back-dated pay rise was backed overwhelmingly at the conference.
However, any ballot on industrial action is still some way off.
Moving the motion, David Baxter from Dundee said: ""A restorative pay rise will boost the economy and is needed to give public sector workers the same spending power they had before austerity and pay freezes and sub-inflation level pay awards.""
He added: ""Teachers are working, on average, 46.5 hours on a contract that pays them for working 35 hours.
""Teachers are being worked harder, paid less and are being seriously under-valued.
""Teachers have had enough. This is the time to act.""
Seconding the motion, Mike Callaghan, from Angus, said: ""If we do not take action now, after at least five years of pay erosion, when will we?""
Teachers' pay is negotiated nationally through a joint body which involves unions, councils and the Scottish government.","Larry Flanagan criticised how some journalists and politicians ""portray a problem as a crisis"". He told the EIS annual meeting in Perth a ""more considered analysis"" would be useful. Mr Flanagan, the general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), expressed his concern about the way journalists and politicians tend to sensationalize issues by labeling them as crises. He argued that a more thoughtful and balanced examination of problems would be more beneficial.

Speaking at the EIS annual meeting in Perth, Flanagan pointed out that the term ""crisis"" often triggers panic and anxiety, which can hinder productive discussions and problem-solving. According to him, this exaggerated language can also undermine trust in institutions, such as education.

Flanagan emphasized the importance of a more measured approach to analyzing issues, where facts and evidence are thoroughly investigated. He suggested that this would lead to a more informed public discourse and better decision-making.

Overall, Flanagan called for a more considered analysis of problems before labeling them as crises, urging journalists and politicians to take a responsible approach when communicating issues to the public."

"The ex-Labour minister told the BBC unless ""weak spots"" were protected, there was ""no guarantee"" of a reliable nuclear deterrent for the PM ""when he needs to reach for it"".
Ex-Conservative Defence Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind played down the risk.
The comments come ahead of a Commons debate on the future of Trident.
On Monday it was revealed the cost of renewing the system had risen to £31bn.
The government also said the start date for the replacement submarines had been put back until ""the early 2030s"" as it unveiled its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).
The review said the UK was a ""world leader"" in cyber security.
Lord Browne, who was defence secretary between 2006 and 2008, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that ministers had an ""obligation"" to assure MPs all parts of the nuclear deterrent had been assessed against the risk of a cyber attack and that protections were in place.
Lord Browne added: ""If they are unable to do that then there is no guarantee that we will have a reliable deterrent or the prime minister will be able to use this system when he needs to reach for it.""
But Sir Malcolm said: ""The whole point of our nuclear weapons is not whether they would work - 100% guarantee - if they were ever required. You think they will do.
""The question is whether an enemy contemplating aggression would be prepared to take the risk.""
£31bn
In case costs overrun, the government will also set aside £10bn
Previous estimates put the cost at up to £25bn
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""We wouldn't comment on the detail of our security arrangements for the nuclear deterrent but we can and will safeguard it from any cyber threat.
""We are investing more than ever before on the UK's defensive and offensive cyber capabilities to protect our national interests.
""Last week the Chancellor outlined a plan for £1.9bn in cyber investment, including a £165m Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund, to support innovative procurement across both defence and cyber security.""
In the Commons on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed MPs would get a non-binding vote on whether to renew the four submarines carrying the UK's nuclear missiles.
Official Labour policy remains to renew Trident, but party leader Jeremy Corbyn is firmly opposed and a review is taking place to consider the party's stance.
By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor
Lord Browne's comments may be seized on by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn, who are trying to persuade the Labour Party to abandon its support for the deterrent.
The party's leadership is urging its MPs to abstain in a vote later, called by the SNP, that seeks to reject the renewal of Trident.
The vote will not be binding, but Britain's nuclear deterrent is an increasingly expensive, and politically troublesome issue.
Read more from Laura
Labour MPs are being asked to abstain in the vote - but as many as 20 are thought to be prepared to rebel and vote for Trident to be renewed.
Following a meeting of the party's MPs at Westminster on Monday night, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the debate was an ""SNP stunt"".
The SNP has criticised the ""ballooning"" cost of Trident, saying the Commons vote could be ""the last parliamentary chance to stop this utterly awful project"".
Speaking during the SDSR debate, Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, said it was a ""super-expensive vanity project"" which had failed to deter ""against terrorism or cyber attack or conventional attacks on the UK and its allies and friends"".
The defence review committed the government to a debate on the future of Trident, describing renewing the system as a ""national endeavour"".
It did not commit the government to a vote on the main renewal decision, however, during the Commons debate, Mr Cameron said he was ""keen"" to hold a vote ""at the appropriate moment"".
The review said the revised cost - including a £10bn contingency - and timescale of the project reflected the ""greater understanding we now have about the detailed design of the submarines and their manufacture"".
It also pledged £1.9bn over the next five years to protect the UK from cyber attacks.
Other measures in the government's £178bn defence spending plans for the next decade included:","The ex-Labour minister told the BBC unless ""weak spots"" were protected, there was ""no guarantee"" of a reliable nuclear deterrent for the PM ""when he needs to reach for it"". The former Labour minister expressed concerns to the BBC regarding the lack of protection for vulnerable areas of the UK's nuclear deterrent. They suggested that without safeguarding these weak points, the Prime Minister might not be able to rely on the deterrent when necessary."

Gabby Logan, Suzi Perry, Jo Whiley, Helen Skelton and Louise Minchin are just a few of the 21 familiar faces featured in our version of This Girl Can - a national campaign to inspire women of all ages to exercise.
This Girl Can is a Sport England initiative to inspire women of all ages to participate in physical activity and exercise.
Who else is sweating it out in our verison of This Girl Can?
You can watch Kirsty Wark on a chest press machine, Arlene Phillips in a spin class and Anna Foster braving it in her swimming costume. Our video proves that women of all ages can participate in sport and exercise, sweat as much as they like and still be confident about their appearance.
Women are less likely than men to become active because of body image and competency fears, according to Sport England research, so the This Girl Can campaign uses slogans such as ""Sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox"" and images of normal women enjoying sport.
And this tribute film was created to support the message that we as a society need to acknowledge and then break down the emotional barriers that stop a lot of British females from getting active.
The celebrities all volunteered their time for the filming of the video, jumping (sometimes literally) at the chance to be involved. In fact, we had to turn some of the presenters away!
Filming took place in Manchester, Glasgow and London over a three-week period, which saw our presenters taking part in 17 different physical activities including walking, running, numerous exercise classes, gym activities and sports such as netball, football, wall climbing and squash.

"Mike Christie and Jonathan Ansell were attacked at a recreation ground in Yardley, Birmingham, during the early hours.
Christie was hit over the head and Ansell received a blow to the eye as he wrestled back a stolen laptop.
Both singers were treated at Heartlands Hospital but did not report the attack to police.
Ansell and Christie were two of the original members of the group who rose to fame when they came second in the X Factor in 2004, losing to Steve Brookstein.
On Twitter, Christie, 35, expressed his disbelief at the attack after the would-be thief ran off with his rucksack containing a laptop.
Ansell, 34, said he realised crucial information relating to the group was on the laptop and chased and struck the mugger.
He said the pair had gone out ""at midnight-ish"" to ""barn-storm over ideas"" and the plan had been to go to McDonalds.
""All of a sudden I just heard Mike shout out an expletive and saw this figure running off with the rucksack,"" he said.
""I instinctively chased after him and grabbed the bag and ended up with stars in my eyes after being punched in the face.""

Christie was hit over the head and Ansell received a blow to his face. The motive behind the attack is still unclear, but both victims were left with serious injuries and were taken to the hospital for treatment.

According to witnesses, the attack happened around 2 am when the recreation ground was mostly deserted. The assailants, described as two men in their early twenties, approached Christie and Ansell without any apparent provocation.

Christie, a 28-year-old local resident, was struck on the head with a blunt object, causing him to lose consciousness immediately. Ansell, a 31-year-old visitor from another town, was struck on the face, resulting in a broken nose and severe bruising.

Passersby who came across the scene alerted the authorities and called for an ambulance. The victims were swiftly transported to the nearby hospital, where they received medical treatment. Although their injuries were serious, both individuals are expected to make a full recovery.

The police have launched an investigation into the incident and are appealing to the public for any information that can help identify the attackers. Detective Sergeant Emily Johnson, leading the investigation, stated, ""We are treating this attack as an unprovoked act of violence. It is vital that anyone with information comes forward to assist us in bringing these perpetrators to justice"
"Research from China and the US suggests that the innermost core of our planet has another, distinct region at its centre.
The team believes that the structure of the iron crystals there is different from those found in the outer part of the inner core.
The findings are reported in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Without being able to drill into the heart of the Earth, its make-up is something of a mystery.
So instead, scientists use echoes generated by earthquakes to study the core, by analysing how they change as they travel through the different layers of our planet.
Prof Xiaodong Song, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said: ""The waves are bouncing back and forth from one side of the Earth to the other side of the Earth.""
Prof Song and his colleagues in China say this data suggests that the Earth's inner core - a solid region that is about the size of the Moon - is made up of two parts.
The seismic wave data suggests that crystals in the ""inner inner core"" are aligned in an east-to-west direction - flipped on their side, if you are looking down at our planet from high above the North Pole.
Those in the ""outer inner core"" are lined up north to south, so vertical if peering down from the same lofty vantage point.
Prof Song said: ""The fact we are discovering different structures at different regions of the inner core can tell us something about the very long history of the Earth.""
The core, which lies more than 5,000km down, started to solidify about a billion years ago - and it continues to grow about 0.5mm each year.
The finding that it has crystals with a different alignment, suggests that they formed under different conditions and that our planet may have undergone a dramatic change during this period.
Commenting on the research, Prof Simon Redfern from the University of Cambridge said:  ""Probing deeper into the solid inner core is like tracing it back in time, to the beginnings of its formation.
""People have noticed differences in the way seismic waves travel through the outer parts of the inner core and its innermost reaches before, but never before have they suggested that the alignment of crystalline iron that makes up this region is completely askew compared to the outermost parts.
""If this is true, it would imply that something very substantial happened to flip the orientation of the core to turn the alignment of crystals in the inner core north-south as is seen today in its outer parts.""
He added that other studies suggest that the Earth's magnetic field may have undergone a change about half a billion years ago, switching between the equatorial axes and the polar axis.
""It could be that the strange alignment Prof Song sees in the innermost core explains the strange palaeomagnetic signatures from ancient rocks that may have been present near the equator half a billion years ago,"" he added.
""For the moment, however, the model proposed in this paper needs testing against other ways of analysing the seismic properties of Earth's innermost core, since no other researchers have previously considered evidence for the same conclusions in their studies.""
Follow Rebecca on Twitter","Research from China and the US suggests that the innermost core of our planet has another, distinct region at its centre. The team believes that the structure of the iron in the inner core is not uniform and there exists a distinct region within it. This finding challenges the commonly held belief that the inner core is a homogeneous solid. The researchers used seismic data from earthquakes to analyze the behavior of seismic waves as they pass through the core.

In China, scientists used data from over 4,600 seismic events recorded by the Chinese Earthquake Administration over a ten-year period. Meanwhile, in the US, researchers utilized data from the USArray network, which records seismic waves across the country. By examining the patterns and characteristics of these seismic waves, the scientists were able to gain insights into the structure of the inner core.

The research teams discovered that seismic waves passing through the inner core behaved differently depending on their direction and the location of the earthquake. This observation led them to hypothesize the existence of a distinct region within the inner core. The researchers suggest that this region could be composed of a different type of iron or alloys, which gives it different seismic properties.

The distinct region is estimated to be about 250 kilometers in diameter and located at the very center of the inner core. However, due to the limitations of the seismic data, the exact composition and nature of this region remain uncertain.

Understanding the structure and properties of the inner core is crucial for comprehending Earth's internal processes and dynamics. This new finding challenges the conventional model of the Earth's inner core, and further research will be necessary to confirm and refine these findings."
"Blake Ross, who was in care, was reported missing from Howdenhall at 15:15 on Saturday.
After being found unwell 48 hours later on the number four bus at Leopold Place he was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children where he died.
An investigation is now being carried out into the actions the police took in relation to the case.
It has been confirmed that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal had instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) to conduct an independent investigation.
Edinburgh Council will also conduct a multi-agency significant case review into Blake's death.
When a child in care dies, such reviews are standard practice.
Lothian Buses said the driver of the bus radioed his control room to report that Blake was unwell.
A supervisor attended and police were also called before the teenager, who was thought to be one of triplet brothers, was taken to hospital.
The youngster's death, which is understood to have been related to his diabetes, is currently being treated as unexplained and police inquiries are continuing.
Blake had recently featured in a short film produced by Edinburgh Leisure about children in care.

The decision to sell the wood at auction has sparked outrage among environmentalists and local residents who fear that if sold, the woodland could be destroyed or turned into residential or commercial property. Protesters argue that the destruction of ancient woods not only harms biodiversity but also erases important cultural and historical landmarks.

Wineham Properties, the landowner, claims that the sale is necessary for financial reasons and argues that the wood is not designated as a protected area. However, campaigners argue that the ecological and cultural value of the woodland should be prioritized over financial gain.

"Across the UK, there are an estimated 3.3m people eligible to vote for the first time on 7 May.
Since last summer, the Electoral Commission has been working with student bodies and youth groups to encourage them to use their vote.
Traditionally, 18-24 years olds are least likely to turn out, with 44% making it to the ballot box at the 2010 general election.
A range of schemes have been launched to try and get young people more involved in politics, using apps, video blogging and social media campaigns.
Ebun Bola-Shadipe, Cardiff community engagement officer for Bite the Ballot, a not-for-profit movement encouraging young people to vote, said: ""In Wales, there are approximately 298,000 18-24 year olds.  Just imagine if they all went out and voted.
""Let's take the opportunity on Thursday to make a change, let's make sure we're represented and prove to decision-makers that we want more from our democracy.
""If young people in Wales want change then they need to get out and vote.""
However, fears are mounting that turnout among young people will fall at this election, with changes to the way people register to vote meaning tens of thousands are missing from the electoral roll.
The Electoral Reform Society has warned that Wales is facing a ""turnout time-bomb"", calling for a ""radical overhaul"" of politics teaching in schools.

"Mauger, a former New Zealand back, will leave the role following Saturday's Premiership game against Northampton.
O'Connor, who won three Premierships as a Tigers coach, will take over in early April, subject to being issued a visa.
Mauger had been in charge since the long-serving Richard Cockerill was sacked as director of rugby in January.
O'Connor, 46, worked under Cockerill between 2010 and 2013, before leaving to take the top job at Leinster and subsequently going to work for Queensland Reds and Tonga.
The switch has been announced just a day after the Premiership's fifth-placed side edged out Exeter in the Anglo-Welsh Cup final to claim the club's first silverware in four years.
""We're delighted that Matt O'Connor has accepted an offer to return to Welford Road,"" said Tigers chairman Peter Tom. ""The club has conducted an exhaustive search to find the right person.
""One of the most significant factors in our deliberations was experience of the Premiership and what it takes to win the competition.
""Matt has that experience as head coach during a successful period. The team also topped the try-scoring figures in the Premiership four times in that five-year period with Matt in charge of the attack.""
Leicester wing Telusa Veainu expressed his surprise, tweeting: ""With 5 games to go, really?? We don't know how good we've got it! #biggerpicture #gutted.""
Analysis - 'A big hit returns'
Chris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live's rugby reporter
""The management situation at Welford Road over the past few seasons has been a confusing one.
""O'Connor was a big hit as head coach at the club, winning two Premiership titles working under Richard Cockerill, before leaving to became the main man at Leinster in 2013.
""Then Aaron Mauger came in to much fanfare, before a clash of philosophies with Cockerill led to the latter's sacking.
""Now O'Connor has returned to take full charge of team affairs, with Mauger moving on.
""O'Connor will head up the coaching, with the club changing the structure of the organisation in the absence of a director of rugby figure.""
Former Australia Test centre O'Connor worked as assistant coach with Brumbies and Australia 'A' before first arriving in Leicester in the summer of 2008
In his first stint at the club, working with Cockerill, the Tigers won the Premiership in 2009, 2010 and 2013, the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2012 and reached the 2009 European Cup Final.
Since leaving Welford Road in 2013, O'Connor has worked with Leinster, who he led to the Pro12 title in his first season, Queensland Reds and Tonga.
Former All Blacks centre Mauger had been back at Welford Road as head coach since the start of 2015-16 season.
""While preparing to welcome Matt, we are also disappointed to lose Aaron,"" added Tom. ""Matt's strengths are in his work with players on the training pitch and we are making changes to our organisational structure to enable him to focus solely on the success of the team.
""Matt has a good record in the Premiership and had a lot of success in his previous spell here,"" said club captain Tom Youngs. ""At the same time, it is disappointing that Mage is leaving the club. He's a good man and a good rugby man.""","Mauger, a former New Zealand back, will leave the role following Saturday's Premiership game against Northampton. O'Connor, who won three Premierships as a Tigers coach, will take over in early 2022.

Mauger's departure comes after a string of disappointing performances by the Leicester Tigers, who currently sit at the bottom of the Premiership table. The 38-year-old former All Black joined the coaching staff in 2018 as an attack coach before taking over as head coach in 2019.

During his tenure, Mauger led the Tigers to a seventh-place finish in the Premiership in the 2019-20 season. However, the team struggled to find consistency and failed to make further progress in subsequent seasons.

O'Connor, on the other hand, brings a wealth of experience to the role. The 51-year-old Australian served as the Tigers' head coach from 2008 to 2013, winning three Premiership titles during his tenure. He also spent time as head coach of the Queensland Reds and had a brief stint as the Wallabies' head coach.

O'Connor's return to Leicester is seen as a move to revive the club's fortunes and bring back the winning mentality that was synonymous with the Tigers during his previous spell in charge. His appointment has been met with excitement and optimism among the fans, who are hopeful that he can lead the team to success once again.

Leicester Tigers CEO Andrea Pinchen expressed her gratitude to Mauger for his contribution to the club and wished him the best for his future endeavors. She also expressed her confidence in O'Connor's ability to turn the team's fortunes around and bring back the glory days to Welford Road.

With O'Connor set to take charge in early 2022, Leicester Tigers fans will be eagerly anticipating the changes he brings and the impact he can make on the team's performances."
"Kim Jong-il, North Korea's ""Dear Leader"", was in the process of grooming Kim Jong-un as his successor when he died on 17 December 2011.
Immediately after his father's death, the younger Kim was hailed as ""the great successor"". He was named head of the party, state and army within a fortnight of his father's death.
In January 2016, Mr Kim shot to global headlines again when he oversaw what the regime claimed was an underground hydrogen bomb test - its second nuclear test since he came to power.
Previously, his most high-profile act had been to purge and execute his uncle, Chang Song-thaek, who state media said had been plotting a coup, in December 2013.
Little is still known about the elusive young man who is the youngest son of Kim Jong-il and his late third wife Ko Yong-hui.
Born in 1983 or early 1984, he was initially not thought to be in the frame to take up his father's mantle.
Analysts focused their attention on his half-brother Kim Jong-nam and older full brother Kim Jong-chol.
However Kim Jong-nam's deportation from Japan in May 2001 and middle brother Kim Jong-chol's apparent ""unmanliness"" improved his chances.
Analysts saw him as the coming man after he was awarded a series of high-profile political posts.
Swiss-educated like his brothers, Kim Jong-un avoided Western influences, returning home when not in school and dining out with the North Korean ambassador.
After his return to Pyongyang, he is known to have attended the Kim Il-sung Military University.
His mother was thought to be Kim Jong-il's favourite wife, and she clearly doted on her son, reportedly calling him the ""Morning Star King"".
In his 2003 book, I Was Kim Jong-il's Chef, a Japanese man writing under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto also claimed that Kim Jong-un was his father's favourite.
In August 2010 Kim Jong-il visited China. One South Korean TV station cited a South Korean official as saying Kim Jong-un had accompanied his father on the trip.
Some reports speculated that he had been anointed successor partly because of his resemblance to North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung.
A few North Korea watchers went so far as to say that he may have had plastic surgery to enhance the resemblance, in a country where the deification of the Kim family is at the heart of its grip on power.
Mr Kim made his first public speech as North Korea marked the 100th anniversary of the birthday of Kim Il-sung on 15 April 2012, praising the ""military first"" doctrine and vowing the time his nation could be threatened was ""forever over"".
""Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolised by imperialists,"" he said, adding: ""We have to make every effort to reinforce the people's armed forces.""
Not much was known of Mr Kim's personal life until television footage of an unidentified woman attending events with him surfaced. In July 2012, state media announced that Mr Kim was married to ""Comrade Ri Sol-ju"".
Little is know of Ms Ri, but her stylish appearance - short, chic haircut and Western dress - led some analysts to suggest that she was from an upper-class family and that she fits Mr Kim's efforts to project a more relaxed image compared to his predecessors.
Details surrounding the marriage of Mr Kim to Ms Ri remain unclear. Most reports had suggested that Ms Ri may have been a singer who caught Mr Kim's attention during a performance.
Aside from attending official events, the couple's public appearances have included visits to an amusement park and watching a concert featuring Disney characters.
American basketball star Dennis Rodman, who met Mr Kim in 2013 and 2014, told The Guardian newspaper that Mr Kim had a daughter.
In 2012, Mr Kim was appointed marshal - the highest military rank - following a high-level military reshuffle in which army chief Ri Yong-ho was removed.
Since then some of North Korea's actions have elicited condemnation from the international community.
A few months into his leadership, in April 2012, North Korea launched a rocket which it said would put a satellite into orbit. The unsuccessful launch was seen by many as a banned test of long-range missile technology.
This attempt was followed by a successful launch of a satellite into space, using a three-stage rocket, in December 2012. South Korea, Japan and the US said the launch was a disguised missile test, and the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution condemning the launch and tightening sanctions.
In February 2013, North Korea carried out a third nuclear test, said to be twice as big as the 2009 test. This resulted in fresh sanctions from the UN Security Council.
In April 2013, heightened tension in the peninsula saw North Korea withdraw workers from the Kaesong industrial zone, jointly run with South Korea and the last symbol of inter-Korean co-operation. The zone was reopened in the following September after negotiations.
In January 2016, the regime made an as-yet unproven claim that it had successfully carried out its first underground hydrogen bomb test, triggering a global outcry and fears that the state, which has few allies, had acquired a more advanced nuclear capability than previously known.
The purge of his uncle in late 2013 caused international concern. Mr Chang was vice-chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission who sat at the heart of the country's leadership, and was seen as a major figure in Mr Kim's administration.
In his first public reference to the execution in a message broadcast on 1 January 2014, Mr Kim spoke of the ""elimination of factionalist filth"".","Kim Jong-il, North Korea's ""Dear Leader"", was in the process of grooming Kim Jong-un as his successor when he died on 17 December 2011. Immediately after his father's death, the power transition to Kim Jong-un was relatively smooth. Kim Jong-un was declared the Supreme Leader of North Korea and the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea. He also assumed the titles of Chairman of the Central Military Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.

Kim Jong-un, who was in his late twenties at the time, quickly consolidated his power and asserted his authority. In the years following his father's death, Kim Jong-un made several key appointments, replacing top military and party officials with loyalists. He also executed high-ranking officials who were seen as a potential threat to his rule, including his uncle Jang Song-thaek in 2013.

Under Kim Jong-un's leadership, North Korea continued to pursue its nuclear weapons program and conducted multiple missile tests, defying international condemnation and sanctions. He launched a series of purges within the military, reportedly to eliminate disloyal elements.

Despite his youth and relative inexperience, Kim Jong-un projected an image of strength and control through a combination of propaganda, repression, and carefully choreographed public appearances. He cultivated a personality cult, following in the footsteps of his predecessors, portraying himself as a fearless and revered leader.

To consolidate his position further, Kim Jong-un initiated economic and political reforms, including the introduction of limited market elements and a focus on agricultural development. He also implemented policies to enhance the country's military capabilities and strengthen North Korea's position on the global stage.

While the exact details of power consolidation and governance in North Korea are difficult to ascertain due to the regime's secretive nature, it is evident that Kim Jong-un has managed to maintain a tight grip on power and continues to rule with an iron fist."
"The programme's future on ITV1 had been the subject of intense speculation for some time.
ITV confirmed it had decided not to commission any further series of Taggart for the ITV network.
Programme producers STV said they were exploring a range of options with other broadcasters to keep Taggart going.
The company said it was committed to the brand and recognised the continuing popularity of this long-running series.
It is believed the company will look at possible co-financing deals with other UK-based channels or foreign broadcasters.
An ITV spokesman said: ""Since it was first broadcast in 1983, Taggart has been one of ITV's most enduring dramas but, reflecting the demands of our audience and as part of the ongoing creative renewal of the ITV1 schedule, our priority is to invest in new and original drama for the channel.""
He added: ""ITV1 broadcast five out of the top 10 new dramas on any channel last year, including the most popular new drama in over five years, Downton Abbey.
""A broad range of new drama series premiering on the channel over 2011 includes Marchlands, Vera, Injustice, Scott & Bailey, The Jury and DCI Banks.""
Two years ago, Taggart came close to being axed but STV and ITV worked out a co-production deal.
This meant that STV paid a significant proportion of the production cost itself but also gained the right to screen the series before it was shown across the network.
Previously STV had simply been commissioned by ITV to make the series and it was shown across the whole of the UK simultaneously.
The most recent series was shown in the STV region last autumn while viewers in the rest of the UK saw the acclaimed costume drama Downton Abbey. Taggart's ratings within the STV region remained strong.
But when the series was shown on the network a few months later, it was a different story. Taggart's ratings across the UK fell to 3.8 million for the most recent series - considered poor for a mainstream drama.
In recent years, ITV has axed a number of long-running dramas - notably Heartbeat and The Bill - to put more effort into bringing new shows to the screen.
Although Taggart had lost its popularity on ITV1, it remains popular in Scotland and is important to STV commercially and the television industry in Scotland.
For instance, STV generates money from Taggart through sales to foreign broadcasters - over the years it has been screened in many countries around the world.
Distributor DRG said Taggart was a ""hugely popular"" series internationally, airing across three different TV channels in Australia alone.
A DRG spokesperson added: ""It's our shared ambition to return Taggart to UK screens and we can confirm we're currently working closely with STV as we explore options to achieve this.""
ITV did recently commission another drama from STV - a 90-minute one-off called Fast Freddie, The Widow and Me, which is expected to be shown over Christmas.
STV and ITV recently ended a long-running legal dispute amicably. The dispute was triggered by STV's decision to drop a number of ITV network programmes but touched on many other matters.
ITV sources are stressing the decision to discontinue Taggart was a purely creative decision, completely unconnected with the dispute.","The programme's future on ITV1 had been the subject of intense speculation for some time. ITV confirmed it had decided not to commission any further series of Taggart for the foreseeable future. The popular detective drama had been on the air for over 27 years, making it one of the longest-running television series in the UK.

The decision not to continue with Taggart came as a surprise to many loyal viewers. The show had a dedicated fan base and consistently attracted high ratings. However, ITV cited declining viewership and a desire to move in a different direction as the reasons behind their decision.

Taggart, set in Glasgow, Scotland, followed the investigations of the city's fictional murder squad. The gritty and realistic portrayal of crime had won the show critical acclaim and a devoted following. The lead character, Detective Chief Inspector Jim Taggart, had become a household name and was played by actor Mark McManus until his death in 1994. After McManus' passing, the show continued with other lead characters, but it never quite captured the same level of success as during his tenure.

Despite its long run, Taggart had faced numerous challenges over the years. Changes in cast and production staff, as well as a shift in focus to more self-contained storylines, had caused some fans to lose interest. However, the show's strong storytelling and character development kept many viewers engaged until the end.

Fans of Taggart expressed their disappointment and frustration at ITV's decision. Social media platforms were flooded with messages pleading for the network to reconsider. Many viewers felt that there was still much potential for the show to explore and that it had been prematurely cut off.

ITV, however, remained firm in their decision. They stated that they were committed to bringing new and fresh content to their viewers and that Taggart no longer fitted within their programming strategy. They expressed gratitude to the cast, crew, and fans for their support over the years.

As of now, the future of Taggart remains uncertain. It is possible that another network or streaming service may pick up the show, or it could fade into television history as a beloved but discontinued series. Regardless, the impact and legacy of Taggart will continue to be felt by fans who appreciated its distinct take on crime drama."

Mr St Leger, 33, who lives in Yatton, north Somerset said: ""I have been making things with the wrappers for as long as I can remember.""
""Both my brother Samuel and I used to make little men or dinosaurs whenever we had a Tunnocks caramel wafer.
""The wrapper on a Tunnocks is quite unique in that it's kind of a foil and paper combo and it seems to work beautifully for making things with.""
When taking breaks from his job, Mr St Leger began making and leaving the ""wrapper raptors"" at the nearby Spike Island cafe where staff started keeping them in a collection.
""After that I decided to start blogging them on Tumblr more for my own amusement than anything,"" he said.
But the models, which range from a menacing pack of T-Rexes to airborne Pterosaurs and even tiny dinosaur eggs, soon created their own fan base among his colleagues.
Mr St Leger said: ""Two exceptional Aardman directors Richard Webber and Merlin Crossingham, animator and director extraordinaire Jane Davies-Watkins kindly got involved after seeing the blog and my disgustingly talented brother has done a fair few.

The tiny and shiny prehistoric creatures even have their own names and unique features. St Leger's love for dinosaurs began as a child and has remained a constant inspiration throughout his life. He would spend hours studying dinosaur books and magazines, drawing and sketching these ancient creatures on any surface he could find.

As an illustrator, St Leger has a keen eye for detail and a passion for bringing his creations to life. He believes that every medium, no matter how unconventional, can be used to express one's artistic vision. That's when he stumbled upon the idea of using discarded biscuit and tea-cake wrappers to form his dinosaur sculptures.

To begin the process, St Leger carefully selects the wrappers with colors and patterns that resemble the scales and skin of various dinosaur species. He then meticulously folds, cuts, and shapes the wrappers, transforming them into three-dimensional miniaturized dinosaurs. Using adhesive and other craft materials, he adds unique features and intricate details to each creature, giving them their own personalities and characteristics.

St Leger's mini-masterpieces have gained recognition and admiration from art enthusiasts and dinosaur lovers alike. With each creation, he not only pays homage to these magnificent creatures but also encourages others to appreciate the beauty and ingenuity of art in unconventional forms.

Through his work, St Leger hopes to inspire others to see the potential in everyday objects and to embrace their creativity in unique and unexpected ways. Whether it's transforming biscuit wrappers into"

"Vincent Cassidy was walking with Ross Sherlock, having collected his children from primary school, when a gunman opened fire in Bishopbriggs.
Mr Cassidy said he froze and did not see the gunman's face.
He was giving evidence at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter who both deny attempting to murder Mr Sherlock on 24 September 2015.
The jury at the High Court in Glasgow heard that Mr Cassidy and Mr Sherlock had collected their children from St Helen's Primary and were walking along chatting when the attack happened.
A man wearing fluorescent yellow clothing appeared, produced a gun and fired at Mr Sherlock who ran off.
The jury has previously heard that one of the shots fractured Mr Sherlock's arm.
Mr Cassidy was asked by prosecutor Richard Goddard: ""Does your police statement say; 'The one thing I noticed was that he didn't fancy chasing after Ross. He only took a few steps and then stopped and fired'?""
He replied: ""Yes. I said that.""
He did not agree, however, that he had given police a description of the gunman's face, his height and build.
When asked about those parts of his statement Mr Cassidy replied: ""I've signed the statement but I did not say these words. I didn't see the face at all.""

"However, it remains uncertain how many people will come to the UK when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year, said the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007 but faced some restrictions on the kind of jobs they could take.
Pressure group Migration Watch UK called the report a ""whitewash"".
According to a British Labour Force sample survey, there are currently 26,000 Bulgarians and 80,000 Romanians living in the UK, but the actual numbers could be larger, according to the report.
Q&A: End of Bulgaria and Romania work restrictions
There was no evidence to support a public perception that migration from Romania and Bulgaria would put pressure on social housing, the NIESR report said.
The NIESR did not offer any estimates on migrants as it was not asked to by the British Embassy in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, which commissioned and funded the research.
Instead it looked at where migrants had already gone and their characteristics.
""They are young, they tend to be on their own, and they make limited demands on services,"" NIESR researcher Heather Rolfe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
She said the researchers examined the likely impact on services if Romanians and Bulgarians were to come.
""There is no need to panic,"" she concluded.
The report said the impact on services, including housing, education, welfare and health, is likely to be greater if Romanians and Bulgarians move to the UK longer-term.
And while evidence from local surveys showed that Romanians and Bulgarians were interested in coming to the UK, many were considering temporary stays rather than long-term moves.
The main reason for the ""modest impact"" is that the UK is not the only country that will be lifting restrictions at the end of the year, as France and Germany are also allowing more Romanians and Bulgarians in. Many migrants have also gone to Spain and Italy, the research said.
Romanian and Bulgarian migrants to the UK are likely to be low-skilled workers, employed in construction, catering, hospitality, and as carers or cleaners, the report added.
Studies covering Eastern European migrants found them to be less likely to claim benefits than other migrant groups or the general population, the report said, adding that of those who claim benefits now, the majority receive child benefits.
But there is a limited amount of evidence on the impact of migrants on the welfare system, the NIESR study said.
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has previously said that ministers do not know how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK when restrictions are relaxed.
He also said he had no confidence in figures, published on his department's own website, predicting about 13,000 will arrive.
Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for tougher controls on immigration, said: ""This report is a bucket of whitewash.
""In 60 pages it produces no estimate whatever of the likely future scale of Romanian and Bulgarian migration to the UK.
""It brushes aside any indication of an increase in migration from these countries whose workers are amongst the most mobile in the EU. Furthermore, it avoids tackling the key question of how many Romanian and Bulgarian migrants now in Spain and Italy might transfer to Britain.""
Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch UK, said its own research had estimated about 50,000 a year would arrive. Ms Rolfe dismissed that figure as ""a stab in the dark"".
Minister for Europe David Lidington welcomed the report as a contribution to the debate on migration.
""The report will help to shape this government's work to build an immigration system which works in the national interest - supporting the UK economy by continuing to attract the brightest and the best global talent at the same time as protecting our public services and ensuring our welfare system is not open to abuse,"" he said.
""Our tough new rules are already taking effect, with overall net migration falling by almost one-third since 2010.""
The research included a review of data and of research literature from the UK, Romania and Bulgaria.","However, it remains uncertain how many people will come to the UK when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year, said the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The institute stated that while there may be a surge in visitors initially, it is difficult to predict their numbers accurately due to various factors such as travel uncertainties, potential ongoing health concerns, and changing international travel regulations. Additionally, the recovery of the travel and tourism industry may take some time, and it is uncertain how quickly demand will rebound.

In December, police arrested Mr Palmer's media advisor Andrew Crook over his part in the alleged scheme.
Police said Mr Palmer knew nothing about the alleged conspiracy.
Tony Smith, who is also a former Australian footballer, is alleged to have organised the ""very elaborate"" and ""bizarre"" scheme, police said.
Mr Smith allegedly threatened to use corrupt police to have his former manager at National Australia Bank (NAB) jailed for life in Indonesia, local media reported.
Mr Crook, who has also worked as a publicist for Mr Smith, was allegedly an accomplice in luring the banker to Indonesia with a bogus offer of a job with Mr Palmer.
The banker was a witness in a legal case involving Mr Smith and NAB. The conspirators allegedly tried to get him to recant his evidence.
Police said the banker was held for several hours, and had his mobile phone, wallet and passport taken.
The charges came hours before a decision by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman to call a snap state government election for 31 January.
Mr Newman visited Government House this morning to meet Acting Governor Tim Carmody for the issue of writs for an election.
Mr Newman is a fierce political rival of Clive Palmer, a billionaire miner whose Palmer United Party's senators wield crucial swing votes in the federal parliament.
Mr Palmer said his party would stand candidates across Queensland. He described the snap election as a response to Mr Newman's deteriorating popularity as premier.
""Of course the polls have moved drastically against the government, more Queenslanders are moving against him and that's why he's moved so quickly, because he's running scared,"" Mr Palmer told ABC News.
Mr Palmer, who made his fortune in mining and won a seat in the lower house of parliament in 2013, said at the time of Mr Crook's arrest he did not know anything about the allegations.
But he appeared to suggest that the case could be politically motivated, saying that the Queensland government ""don't like the opposition we've been giving them in the Senate"".
""I'm personally very concerned because Mr Crook is our media advisor and if they wanted to attack me or our party they can do that,"" he said.
Police brushed aside Mr Palmer's claim the police investigation could be politically motivated, saying it stemmed from a pre-existing investigation connected to a civil matter dating back to 2012.","Multi-millionaire Tony Smith is charged with being part of a conspiracy to kidnap a bank executive. In December, police arrested Mr Palmer's media advisor Andrew Crook over his part in the alleged conspiracy. According to police reports, Crook had been in contact with Smith and other individuals involved in the plan. The authorities have uncovered a series of encrypted messages exchanged between Crook and Smith, discussing the details of the kidnapping plot.

Investigators have also identified two other individuals, yet to be apprehended, believed to be part of the conspiracy. The police suspect that these individuals were responsible for carrying out the actual kidnapping, while Smith and Crook played more strategic roles in the planning and financing of the operation.

Tony Smith, a well-known figure in the business world, has built his empire through various successful ventures, including real estate, technology, and investments. With an estimated net worth in excess of $100 million, he has become a prominent and influential figure in both business and political circles.

The motive behind the planned kidnapping appears to be financial gain. The targeted bank executive, John Sullivan, is known for his high-profile position overseeing a major financial institution. Rumors have circulated that Smith had a personal vendetta against Sullivan, possibly linked to a business deal gone wrong in the past.

Smith's lawyers have vehemently denied any involvement in the alleged conspiracy, claiming that the encrypted messages found on Crook's device were misinterpreted. They argue that Smith was only discussing a legitimate business proposal with Crook and had no knowledge or intention of any criminal activity.

The trial is scheduled to start in the coming months, with both Smith and Crook facing charges of conspiracy to kidnap and other related offenses. If convicted, they could face significant jail time and substantial fines. The search for the two remaining suspects is ongoing, with law enforcement agencies dedicating significant resources to their apprehension.

The case has garnered considerable media attention due to Smith's wealth and influence. Critics argue that his financial resources may allow him to secure a high-profile legal defense team, potentially influencing the outcome of the trial. Nevertheless, authorities remain determined to ensure a fair and thorough investigation, guided by the evidence at hand.

As the trial progresses, the full extent of Smith's alleged involvement and the motivations behind the conspiracy will be revealed. The case serves as a reminder that even the wealthiest and most powerful individuals can find themselves entangled in serious criminal charges, emphasizing the importance of accountability and due process within the justice"
"This complex illness has the worst 10-year survival rate of any cancer, with most patients being told they may have less than a year to live.
The bank will collect samples from six hospitals in England and Wales.
The charity that funded it hopes there will eventually be better treatments and earlier diagnosis.
There are 8,875 cases of pancreatic cancer a year in the UK, with almost the same number of people dying from it annually.
Just 1% of sufferers are alive 10 years after diagnosis - a survival rate that is unchanged in 40 years.
Researchers now hope they will be able to improve this dismal picture.
Barts Cancer Institute has praised the ""vision and determination"" of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund (PCRF), which raised Â£2m to fund the bank.
Samples will be collected from consenting patients at six hospitals - in Swansea, Leicester, Oxford and Southampton and Barts and the Royal Free in London.
The tissue will help scientists study genetic changes in the cancerous cells.
The bank will store actual tumour samples - as well as blood, saliva and urine in which proteins indicating cancer can be found - from about 1,000 patients a year.
The aim is to be able to detect cases more quickly.
Prof Hemant Kocher, from Barts Cancer Institute, told me: ""Surgery is possible in only about 10-15% of patients with pancreas cancer at the moment.
""We hope this tissue bank will help us develop diagnostic tests so that more patients can have surgery.
""If diagnosed early enough, they can have surgery.
""It is about the only thing that can give a long-term cure for these patients.
""Pancreatic cancer is a complex disease, with a number of alterations in the cancer cells and the cells surrounding the cancer.
""And it's a deep-seated organ, so tissue isn't always available.
""This means research has really been set back.""
The PCRF's founder, Maggie Blanks, said: ""A nationally co-ordinated tissue bank will not only ensure that more samples become available to researchers, but that these are quality controlled to provide a much better basis for the very best research to be carried out.""
Carol Hayes, from Basildon, was among the first patients to donate tissue to the bank, during a gruelling seven-hour operation last year.
So far, she is clear of pancreatic cancer, though she still needs six-monthly check-ups.
Ms Hayes said: ""It was the only thing I could give back to say thank you and to try and help, because I was borderline lucky.
""Maybe another couple of months down the line, I wouldn't have been able to have the op.
""They said I was borderline, and so many with pancreatic cancer aren't.
""I saw my enemy, the tumour, on a scan.
""It's like I put it in a box and handed it over - so someone could do good with it.""
Adrian Morrish's wife, Noreen, died from pancreatic cancer within a year of being diagnosed, at a time when they should have been planning their golden wedding anniversary.
He said: ""It was a terrible period because I was watching somebody who'd had a very active life go downhill very fast.
""It was an appalling year.
""It was a nightmare when the chemotherapy stopped working.
""It was extremely hard for all the family - they lost their mother and grandmother.
""I realise now what an appalling disease it is, with a minimal survival rate.
""That's why it's so important research projects continue.""","This complex illness has the worst 10-year survival rate of any cancer, with most patients being told they may have less than a year to live. The bank will collect the loan in the event of the borrower's death or default."
"Voters will head to the polls across five Merseyside boroughs plus Halton in Cheshire on 4 May.
You wanted to know about what powers the mayor will have and how the wider region will be affected as the new devolution model takes shape.
We put your questions to the BBC's North West political reporters and political editor.
Q. What will the mayor do for the outer regions that fall into the Liverpool City Region? A small town like Southport's needs are different to a big city?
This is one of the biggest challenges facing the mayor.
In Southport, for example, many people feel they have more in common with Lancashire than Liverpool. Do they want to be included in ""brand Liverpool""?
In St Helens, a group of students said they thought the town possibly had more in common with Manchester, especially given that neighbouring Wigan is part of the Greater Manchester combined authority.
Each of the candidates insist they'll work to ensure all citizens benefit equally.
Interestingly, none of them are actually from the city of Liverpool, so they would all argue they were certainly not Liverpool-centric in their approach.
The mayor will have a strategic overview of the whole city region, which arguably means that, when it comes to investment, they can make decisions based on needs and skills rather than concentrating on one small local authority area.
The mayor will need the backing of each district council leader on matters including spending, and how to develop training and employment.
So, at least in theory, each area will be able to fight its corner and make sure its citizens' voices are heard.
Q. Why do we need three mayors in Liverpool? We will soon have a Lord Mayor, a city mayor and a regional mayor. Plus all their deputies. Isn't this a drain on finances in itself?
This is the question which comes up every time BBC reporters speak to people about plans for a metro mayor.
In Liverpool, there will indeed be three mayors after 5 May. The civic mayor is the one with the gold chains who opens fetes and chairs council meetings.
The role of elected city mayor has existed since 2012 - Joe Anderson is the incumbent; he was re-elected in 2016. Mr Anderson will carry on in the role, though he recently revealed his own ambitions may lie at Westminster.
The city mayor will remain in charge of the city on matters such as planning, school building, investment and culture.
The metro mayor, meanwhile, will be looking strategically across the whole city region and will have powers over local transport budgets, compulsory purchase orders and skills and training for the over 16s.
The metro mayor salary has been set at Â£77,500. The mayor of Liverpool will get Â£79,500 while the Police and Crime Commissioner post will pocket Â£85,000.
The money to run the Combined Authority and the metro mayor's office comes from the devolution deal done with central government.
Q. How will the elected mayor improve the state of some of the roads in the Liverpool City Region?
Repairing pot holes will still be the preserve of the individual local councils.
However, the strategic planning powers of the mayor may mean a more ""joined-up"" approach to identifying pot hole problems, and the mayor will also be well placed to lobby central government for more cash to fix them.
It's important to note the mayor will be in charge of the region's overall transport budget, which could have an impact on the roads.
There will be in regular talks with council leaders over things like highways maintenance, so the mayor is likely to have some clout.","Voters will head to the polls across five Merseyside boroughs plus Halton in Cheshire on 4 May. You wanted to know about what powers the mayor will have and how they will be elected. 

The mayor in each of these areas will have a range of powers and responsibilities, varying to some extent depending on the specific borough. Overall, the mayor's role is to lead the local council, work with councilors to make decisions on local issues, and represent the borough at regional and national levels. They are responsible for setting the council's budget, making policy decisions, and ensuring the delivery of public services in their area.

Some of the key powers and responsibilities of the mayor may include:

1. Strategic planning: The mayor takes a lead role in developing strategic plans for the borough, focusing on areas such as economic development, housing, and infrastructure.

2. Budget management: They have the power to set the council's budget and make decisions on spending priorities, ensuring that public funds are used effectively.

3. Decision-making: The mayor is responsible for leading the council in making key decisions, such as approving major developments or adopting new policies.

4. Representation: The mayor represents the borough at a regional and national level, advocating for the local area's interests and coordinating with other authorities.

5. Engaging with the community: The mayor plays a crucial role in engaging with residents, community groups, and businesses to understand their needs and priorities.

In terms of the election process, the mayor is elected through the supplementary vote system. Voters will be able to select their first and second choices for mayor on the ballot paper. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first-choice votes, they are elected outright. However, if no candidate achieves this majority, the two candidates with the highest number of first-choice votes proceed to a second round. In the second round, all the ballot papers where these two candidates were the first or second choice are counted, and the candidate with the most votes overall is elected as mayor.

It is important to note that the specific powers and election processes may vary slightly between the different boroughs."
"Connie Yates's and Chris Gard's son Charlie is receiving 24-hour treatment for a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness.
UK doctors have said there is no accepted cure and Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.
A High Court judge will decide on Monday what is in his best interests.
The judge will analyse medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division as Charlie's parents seek to keep him on life support at London's Great Ormond Street hospital.
Though born healthy in August 2016, Charlie began to lose weight and strength by the time he was eight weeks old.
He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome - a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness.
Last month, his parents told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that they would continue to fight for their child's survival.
They said: ""He can move his mouth, he can move his hands. He can't open them fully, but he can still open his eyes and see us, in response to us.
""We don't feel he's in pain at all.""
The couple, who live in London, believe Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives pioneering treatment in the US.
""We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,"" Miss Yates said.
""I want to save others. Even if Charlie doesn't make it through this, I don't ever want another mum and their child to go through this.""
Charlie is thought to be just one of 16 children in the world to suffer from mitochondrial depletion syndrome.
Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said: ""Charlie has a very rare and complex disease, for which there is no accepted cure.
""Charlie was very unwell when he was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital and has remained under 24-hour care on our intensive care unit.
""But his condition has continued to deteriorate and we now feel we have exhausted all available proven treatment options.
""We cannot imagine how hugely distressing this is for his family.
""We continue to support them in every way we can, while advocating, what we believe, is best for Charlie.""","Connie Yates's and Chris Gard's son Charlie is receiving 24-hour treatment for a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness. UK doctors have said there is no accepted cure and Charlie has suffered irreversible brain damage. The couple has been fighting for the right to take Charlie to the United States for an experimental treatment, despite the doctors' recommendation to withdraw life-support and allow him to die naturally. The case has gained international attention and has sparked a legal battle, with the UK courts ruling in favor of the doctors and denying the parents' request. The European Court of Human Rights has also sided with the UK courts, stating that further treatment would prolong Charlie's suffering without any realistic prospect of success. Despite the rulings, Connie Yates and Chris Gard have continued to fight for their son's right to receive the experimental treatment. They have raised funds through public donations and have received support from various high-profile individuals and organizations. The case has raised ethical questions about parental rights, the role of the state in life-or-death decisions, and the limits of medical intervention."

He must finish in the top two at the British Championships in Birmingham next month to make the Games in Rio.
""Getting the second Olympic qualifier was the priority,"" Butchart told Scottish Athletics.
""Now I can go to Birmingham with the pressure off in terms of chasing the time.""
Butchart beat Muir's record, which had stood for 36 years, by over four seconds.
""I didn't think about (the record) in California a couple of weeks ago when I went close but my coach and I did say last week that if the race in Holland was as fast as we thought it might be, then there may well be a chance to PB and take the record,"" added Butchart.
""Others can still spoil the party for me, I guess, but I definitely think that for the likes of myself, we've take away one of the barriers.
""The race was fast and I knew with about 800m to go that I'd get the national record. It wasn't the worst feeling in the world, I must admit!""
Butchart was troubled on the last lap of his race by loose laces in his spikes, eventually kicking one shoe off and completing his record-breaking run.
""Before you ask, I had them tied properly - nice and tight - at the start,"" he said.
""But it was wet and the rain seemed to loosen them as the race went on. It wasn't quite like running in flip-flops but it was getting to be a problem.
""With 400m to go I looked down and the right shoe was completely loose and my heel was in danger of coming free. I just had to kick that one off and away and get on with it. I was thinking, this isn't the best time for this to be happening.

"How the system works
The report from the Care Quality Commission that a quarter of home care services are not meeting all the quality and safety standards makes depressing reading.
Evidence of rushed appointments, botched assessment and revolving door of carers suggests the system is on its knees.
The temptation is to think that will all change with the introduction of the cap on costs that the government announced on Monday.
But sadly that is not the case.
The complex nature of the system means the reforms should help reduce the need for people to sell their homes to pay for care.
But they do little - perhaps nothing - to improve the quality of services on offer.
The last decade has seen services squeezed until the pips squeak.
In fact, they have got so bad that just over a year ago the Equality and Human Rights Commission said some services were ""breaching human rights"".
Much of the system - both care homes and home care - is provided by private firms or voluntary sector organisations.
They look after a mix of self-funders - about 500,000 - and those who get state help from councils - just over one million.
Talk to them and they will describe how local authorities have been wanting more for less.
Research by the UK Homecare Association, which represents the firms providing carers to help the elderly with basic tasks such as washing, eating and dressing, shows that councils have been putting pressure on them to reduce the length of visits.
Three quarters are now less than 30 minutes in duration, including 10% which are less than 15 minutes.
Those paying for their own care are not immune - agencies have pared back on their visits to cover costs.
Councils understandably point out that they are doing the best they can.
They have been ploughing more and more into the system as a proportion of their resources at the expense of other areas such as leisure centres and libraries.
Social care, including services for younger disabled adults, now accounts for nearly half of their spending.
But the total pot for care is still shrinking as the huge cuts in government funding for councils - it is falling by over a quarter this parliament - means local authorities have been unable to protect the sector entirely.
The budget for social care stands at just over Â£14bn - a Â£1bn cut in real terms. If that happened in the NHS there would be outrage.
Councils have responded by rationing access to care so only the most needy can get it.
It means despite the ageing population the numbers getting help has actually fallen in the past five years, leaving an estimated one million without any help.
In years gone by these people would have been looked after by younger relatives. But with families more dispersed and the children of the elderly often pensioners themselves this is not always possible.
Stephen  Burke, director of the United for All Ages charity and author of the Good Care Guide, is scathing.
He believes the government has pulled a ""con of the worst sorts"" by giving the impression it has solved the problem of old age care.
Other are more generous.
Councillor David Rogers, from the Local Government Association, has welcomed the cap as an important step forward, but says more needs to be done to tackle the quality issue.
""Without an urgent injection of money to meet rising demand in the short term things will continue to get worse.""
With the over 65 population expected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, expect to hear much more about the care crisis.","How the system works The report from the Care Quality Commission that a quarter of home care services are not meeting all the quality and safety standards makes depressing reading. It highlights a significant problem in the home care sector, where vulnerable individuals rely on these services to maintain their independence and well-being. The system works by providing care services to individuals in their own homes, allowing them to receive assistance with daily tasks and personal care.

However, the report suggests that many of these services are falling short in meeting the necessary quality and safety standards. This raises concerns about the welfare of those receiving care, as well as the effectiveness of the overall system.

There are several reasons behind this failure to meet standards. Firstly, there may be inadequate training and supervision of home care staff, resulting in substandard care being provided. Insufficient staffing levels and high staff turnover rates can also contribute to poor quality care, as it becomes challenging to establish consistent and reliable support for individuals.

Additionally, financial constraints and the pressure to minimize costs may lead to corners being cut, compromising the quality of care provided. Lack of proper oversight and regulation from authorities can further exacerbate these issues, as there is inadequate monitoring and accountability.

To address these problems, it is crucial to prioritize the improvement of the home care system. This includes investing in adequate training and supervision for home care staff, ensuring appropriate staffing levels, and implementing robust quality assurance measures. Regular inspections and audits are also essential to assess and monitor the standard of care being delivered.

Furthermore, adequate funding must be provided to guarantee that home care services can operate at an acceptable level of quality and safety. This may involve increased government funding or the reevaluation of existing funding models to better support the sector.

Overall, improving the quality and safety of home care services is essential to protect vulnerable individuals and ensure their well-being. It requires a collaborative effort involving regulators, care providers, and policymakers to address the shortcomings highlighted in the report and create a system that provides the necessary care and support for those who need it most."
"The team asked 14 volunteers to view pictures of people and faces, while recording the activity of single brain cells.
Scientist said they spotted ""dramatic"" differences in nerve activity at the exact moment a participant learnt of a new link between a person and place.
The early work is published in the journal Neuron.
Brain scientists have long debated exactly how memories are formed, and many questions remain unanswered.
Competing theories include the idea that solitary or just a few nerve cells represent a single person or concept, while others believe a whole host of neurons are needed to form a memory.
A decade ago, a team including Prof Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, discovered a specific ""Jennifer Aniston"" neuron that fired whenever an individual looked at pictures of the actress.
Building on this work, Prof Quiroga, collaborating with Dr Matias Ison, at the University of Leicester, and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, delved further to see if such cells also had a role in making new memories.
To do this, they designed a series of experiments that loosely mimicked a person recollecting meeting someone in a new place.
They asked participants - who had electrodes attached to their brains to monitor nerve activity - to look at pictures of people such as actor Clint Eastwood and Jennifer Aniston.
Throughout each test, researchers recorded which specific nerve cells fired in response to each picture.
They then asked participants to look at images of unrelated landmarks - such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, while mapping separate nerve cells that corresponded to each place.
Images were then digitally merged together, for example to show Clint Eastwood standing in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
Finally, when people were shown pictures of just the tower again - this time with no celebrity posing in front of it - the neuron initially responsive to Clint Eastwood started firing too.
Scientists say this points to rapid links being made between the unrelated celebrity and place.
Dr Matias Ison said: ""This is the first study to look at how a single neuron correlates learning of new contextual associations in the human brain.
""The astonishing fact was that these changes were dramatic, in the sense of neurons changing from being very silent to firing a lot and that these changes occurred at the exact moment of learning.""
The researchers hope this finding will help them better understand the basics of memory creation, though they acknowledge memory is more complex than just forming links between unrelated concepts.
Winrich Freiwald, assistant professor at The Rockefeller University, told the BBC: ""This strengthens the idea that neurons can represent high-level complex entities such as people and landmarks.
""And by studying people at the exact time they learn new associations, the work provides unique insights into the formation of new memories.""","The team asked 14 volunteers to view pictures of people and faces, while recording the activity of single brain cells. Scientist said they spotted ""dramatic"" differences in nerve activity at different times while the volunteers were viewing the pictures.

The scientists found that specific brain cells responded more strongly to pictures of faces compared to pictures of objects or scenes. These cells, known as face cells or face-selective cells, fired at a much higher rate when the volunteers viewed faces.

Furthermore, the researchers discovered that some face cells were particularly selective, responding only to specific features of a face, such as the eyes or mouth. These findings suggest that the brain has specialized cells that are specifically tuned to detect and process facial information.

The scientists also observed that the nerve activity varied over time while the volunteers looked at the pictures. They noticed that the activity of these face cells changed rapidly when the volunteers were presented with different images of faces. This indicates that the brain cells are constantly adapting and responding to visual stimuli in real-time.

These ""dramatic"" differences in nerve activity indicate that the brain is highly dynamic and flexible in processing visual information. It also suggests that the face-selective cells play a crucial role in facial recognition and social interaction.

These findings provide valuable insights into how the brain processes visual information and recognizes faces. Understanding the underlying mechanisms can help scientists develop new methods for diagnosing and treating disorders related to face recognition, such as prosopagnosia (face blindness).

Overall, this study highlights the importance of single neuron recordings in unraveling the complex workings of the human brain and sheds light on the intricate processes involved in recognizing and perceiving faces."
"Ireland come to Cardiff on Friday night with Wales facing criticism after defeats by England and Scotland.
""Perhaps it's a new experience for this group of players but they've got to come through it,"" said McBryde, who played 37 Tests between 1994 and 2005.
""They've got to knuckle down and they've just got to get through it.""
And the former hooker added: ""Until we do get that victory that pressure is going to mount considerably and in adversity that's when you show your true colours.
""We're in a goldfish bowl in Wales and we're aware of it and if the national team doesn't succeed you're going to get a bit of flak and nothing changes.
""[Head coach] Rob Howley, [kicking coach] Neil Jenkins or myself - anyone who was involved in Welsh rugby in the 90s or whatever - we know what it's like and we know there's no other way through it other than just rolling your sleeves up and just going at it again.""
Individual players have been singled out for criticism by former pundits while the coaching team has faced accusations of becoming stale.
Wales have conceded they are out of the title race and have not lost three games during one Six Nations tournament since 2010.
And since 2005 they have won three Grand Slams and one championship title.
It contrasts with a period between 1994 and 2005 when Wales did not win a Six Nations title.
McBryde is hoping the players can channel the pain of a first defeat against Scotland in a decade when they take on an Ireland side trying to set-up a championship showdown with England in Dublin on 18 March.
""For myself personally there's still a level of hurt there from the Scottish defeat,"" he added.
""I'm sure the players are feeling that as well so we have to react in a positive manner in the opening exchanges against what will be a very confident Ireland team.""
Wales have named an unchanged match-day squad with lock Luke Charteris passed fit for his place on the bench after completing return-to-play protocols following a head blow suffered playing for Bath against Wasps on 4 March.
""There's no changes so there's no excuses there really,"" said McBryde.
""We've shown faith in them as coaches that there is a lot more to come from that group of players and they are deserving of their opportunity and this is their shot at it.""
McBryde confirmed Ireland have agreed to the roof of the Principality Stadium being closed for the match.
England insisted that it stayed open for their 23-16 win over Wales in February.","Ireland come to Cardiff on Friday night with Wales facing criticism after defeats by England and Scotland. ""Perhaps it's a new experience for this group of players but they've got to learn to deal with criticism,"" Wales head coach Wayne Pivac said.

Ireland, on the other hand, will be looking to build on their victories over Scotland and Italy in the previous rounds. ""We have been improving with each game and we are determined to continue our winning streak,"" said Ireland captain Johnny Sexton. 
Both teams will be eager to secure a win and get their Six Nations campaign back on track. It will be a highly anticipated match with both sides eager to prove themselves on the international stage."

"The coalition won 88 seats to Labor's 57 in the 150-seat parliament.
Liberal leader Tony Abbott, who will be prime minister, promised a competent and trustworthy government.
Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd earlier admitted defeat and said he would not stand again for the Labor leadership.
The main election issues were how to tackle an expected economic slowdown, whether to keep a tax on carbon emissions, and how to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat.
Mr Rudd had called the election after defeating Julia Gillard in a leadership challenge in June, amid dismal polling figures that showed Labor on course for a wipe-out.
Profile: Tony Abbott
Under Mr Rudd, Labor initially saw its figures improve. But Mr Abbott, who enjoyed the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, then widened the gap again.
""From today I declare Australia is under new management and Australia is now open for business"", Mr Abbott told a cheering crowd as he delivered a victory speech.
He said that he would put the budget back into surplus, and stop boats bringing migrants from Asia.
He added that support for Labor was at its lowest ebb for 100 years, and that the results showed the Australian people would punish anyone who took them for granted.
Mr Rudd said he had phoned Mr Abbott and wished him well.
""I gave it my all but it was not enough for us to win,"" he said. But he was pleased that Labor was preserved as a ""viable fighting force for the future"".
Mr Rudd retained his seat in the Brisbane constituency of Griffith but said he would not re-contest the Labor party leadership because the Australian people ""deserve a fresh start"".
""I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight. As your Labor leader I accept it as my responsibility,"" he said.
The Australian Election Commission confirmed on its website that the Liberal-National coalition had won 88 seats in the House of Representatives, and Labor 57.
Three seats were distributed between three small parties, and there were two seats still to return results.
In the previous parliament, Labor relied on the support of independents and the Greens for its minority government, with 71 seats to the coalition's 72.
Mr Abbott took on the leadership of the flagging Liberal-National coalition in 2009.
A Rhodes scholar who once wanted to be a Roman Catholic priest, Mr Abbott has pledged to repeal both the mining and carbon taxes introduced by Labor.
He has also promised a raft of budget cuts, including reducing the foreign aid budget by A$4.5bn ($4bn; Â£2.6bn).
But he says he will fund an expanded paid parental leave scheme.
British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first to congratulate him on the victory, writing on Twitter that ""it'll be great working with another centre-right leader"".

Labor's six years in power are  emphatically over. Australia's economic growth during difficult global financial times should have played well for an incumbent government. But the economy has begun to slow and Kevin Rudd's Labor party has been  undone by disunity and infighting. The rivalry between Mr Rudd and Julia Gillard which saw the leadership of the party and the country switch back  and forth did not sit well with voters.
You sense  from voters that Mr Abbott's victory is not so much a ringing endorsement as a rejection of  Labor. He's a conservative who has promised a tough line on immigration and asylum-seekers. He opposes gay marriage and has been a sceptic on climate      change. Kevin Rudd sold himself as the comeback kid. It didn't work. His  party now faces a period of further introspection.
Australia largely avoided the recession that hit the UK and other Western nations thanks to a natural resources boom.
But the boom is coming to an end, and Mr Abbott will be charged with managing the transition.
Ahead of the polls, his coalition highlighted bitter Labor infighting, seeking to portray itself as the more stable party.
And former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the internal divisions for Labor's defeat.
""I really believe this was an election that was lost by the government rather than one that was won by the opposition,"" he said.
Julia Gillard, meanwhile, congratulated the Labor candidate who succeeded her in her seat, as she bowed out of politics.
The outsider candidates had mixed fortunes at the polls.
One of the two undecided seats in the House sees billionaire Clive Palmer, famous for his attempt to build a new version of the Titanic based on the original designs, on course for victory.
However, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange missed out on a Senate seat in Victoria, where the final place was claimed by Rick Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party.
More than 14 million people were registered to vote in Saturday's election. Voting is compulsory in Australia.","The coalition won 88 seats to Labor's 57 in the 150-seat parliament. Liberal leader Tony Abbott, who will be prime minister, promised a competent and trustworthy government. Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd conceded defeat and congratulated Abbott on his victory.

"The 29-year-old Wimbledon champion replaced Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings at the end of 2016.
Murray returns to Grand Slam action at the Australian Open in Melbourne next week, where he has been runner-up on five occasions.
""The reality is, in sport, that things obviously keep moving on, the game will get better,"" the Scot said.
""I'll obviously get older, the young guys will continue to improve, and also Novak, Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Rafa Nadal and all the guys at the top are still going to be wanting to get there.
""I need to continue to improve. I for sure need to keep working hard.''
Murray's first-round match against unseeded Ukrainain Illya Marchenko is scheduled third on Monday on Rod Laver Arena, following Simona Halep v Shelby Rogers and Kateryna Kozlova v Venus Williams.
Play begins at 00:00 GMT.
Murray's successful 2016 - in which he also became Wimbledon champion for the second time and defended his Olympic title - ended with him being awarded a knighthood in the Queen's New Year Honours list.
But he says he has not been treated any differently by his fellow competitors.
""It kind of happened for me right at the end of the year, so I haven't been on the Tour much as the number one player,"" said Murray.
""So I haven't noticed it yet. I don't know if that will come over time, if I'm able to stay there or not.""
Murray was also asked about Michael Downey's resignation as chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association after only three years in the role.
He said it was ""disappointing"" and another example of short-term thinking at the top of British tennis.
""I think for a system that - maybe everyone would say - has not really worked for quite a long time, for change to happen you need someone, or a team, in there that's going to be in it for the long haul and not just a few years,"" he added.
Despite winning 17 Grand Slam titles, including four in Australia, Roger Federer said he was ""clearly an underdog"" in Melbourne.
""Yeah, why not for a change? I mean, I prefer to be the favourite. Underdog is OK,"" said Federer, who could meet Murray in the quarter-finals should they both progress.
The 35-year-old, who is returning from a six-month knee injury lay-off, is seeded 17th and will play veteran Austrian Jurgen Melzer, 35, who came through qualifying.
Federer v Melzer is the final match of day one on Rod Laver Arena.
Second seed Djokovic starts the defence of his Australian Open title against former world number seven Fernando Verdasco of Spain, but will do so without the guidance of former coach Boris Becker, with whom he split late last year.
Djokovic, 29, would not be drawn on comments made by the German, in which he said the Serb had dropped his intensity in training which had contributed to a loss of form.
""We've had amazing success. It's all I can say. I don't want to go back and comment on anything,"" said Djokovic, who is looking for record seventh Australian Open crown.
""I kept a very friendly relationship with Boris. We just went separate ways.""","The 29-year-old Wimbledon champion replaced Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings at the end of 2016. Murray returns to Grand Slam action at the Australian Open in Melbourne , where he reached the final five times in his career. However, Murray has been fighting injuries and is seeking to regain his form.

Murray has had a successful career, winning three Grand Slam titles, including Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, and the US Open in 2012. He has also won numerous other tournaments and has been a crucial part of the British Davis Cup team, helping them win the competition in 2015.

Despite his achievements, Murray has faced his fair share of setbacks. In recent years, he has struggled with a nagging hip injury that required surgery in January 2018. He attempted a comeback in 2019 but was limited by the injury and eventually underwent a second surgery later that year.

After a long recovery process, Murray made his return to the tennis circuit in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the tennis calendar, and Murray's progress was further hampered. He was unable to compete in the Australian Open that year due to a positive COVID-19 test.

Now, Murray is hoping to make a successful return to the Australian Open in 2022. He has received a wildcard entry to the tournament, indicating that he is not currently ranked high enough to qualify on his own merit. Nevertheless, Murray remains optimistic and determined to compete at the highest level.

Murray's journey back to the top will undoubtedly be challenging, as he faces fierce competition from younger and fitter opponents. However, his experience, determination, and skill make him a force to be reckoned with. Tennis fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating his return and hoping for another memorable performance from the former world number one."

It was unveiled by MP Jacob Rees Mogg who said the community should celebrate his ""remarkable life"".
Chairman of Saltford Environment Group, Phil Harding, has carried out Phil Harding, has carried out extensive research on Admiral Kelly's life.
He said he was astounded to discover his contribution to help end slavery, and provide support for the education of children in the 19th Century.
Early in his career Admiral Kelly fought the French and Spanish Fleets in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.
At the end of his active service he freed 350 slaves.
He was also part of HMS Pheasant's anti-slavery patrols off the coast of Africa from 1818 to 1822, following the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in 1807.
He intercepted and examined several Portuguese, French and Spanish vessels suspected to be capable of carrying slaves - freeing many hundreds more.
Admiral Kelly was also one of the first directors of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and held directorships of a number of railway companies in the south of England.
A bequest after his death led to the building of Kelly College in Tavistock, Devon, - now known as Mount Kelly.","Admiral Benedictus Kelly lived in Saltford House, near Bath, from 1856 until 1867 when he died.

He was known for his bravery and dedication to this cause, often defying dangerous circumstances to rescue enslaved individuals and bring them to safety.

Admiral Kelly's efforts in combating the slave trade were celebrated not only in his lifetime but also in the years following his death. His work was recognized by both the British government and various anti-slavery organizations, who praised his tireless commitment to ending the inhumane practice.

During his time in Saltford House, Admiral Kelly used it as a base from which he organized and executed numerous operations against slave traders in West Africa. He established a network of informants and allies, gathering intelligence on the whereabouts of slave ships and their departure times. This vital information allowed him to intercept these vessels and free the enslaved people held captive on board.

Kelly's interventions were often perilous, involving high-speed chases, confrontations with armed slavers, and rescues in treacherous conditions. His relentless pursuit of justice made him a feared nemesis among slave traders and a beacon of hope for those trapped in bondage.

"Jenni Morton-Humphreys, from Bristol, found her bike on social media. She met and tricked the culprit to get it back.
She said: ""I cycled on the pavement, fell off a couple of times, then I saw a corner, took it and cycled as fast as I could and didn't look back.""
Police say such actions gives suspects a head start in destroying evidence.
An Avon and Somerset police spokesman said: ""We'd advise against people taking matters into their own hands due the risks involved and the fact it provides criminals with an opportunity to destroy evidence before we can investigate them.
""In this case we've carried out a full investigation into the theft of the bike and have kept in regular contact with the victim throughout.
""We have exhausted all current possible lines of enquiry pending new information.""
The £800 Cube bike was stolen about six weeks ago from a bike rack at the Harbourside in Bristol.
As soon as Ms Morton-Humphreys realised it had gone, she posted photos of her bike on a Bristol Cycling Facebook appealing for its return.
Within two hours a member of the Facebook group saw it advertised for sale for £100.
He then remained in touch with the seller, saying his 'sister' wanted it and arranged for them to meet the following day.
Ms Morton-Humphreys took a friend who remained close by for safety during the sting.
She said: ""I made sure I didn't have any other possessions on me in case they said 'why don't you give us your phone, or give us your money or bank card' or something.
""If I just gave them some keys and cigarettes they would think I would come back.
""In fact it was two keys to the bike locks that they had cut off my bike.""
After cycling away, her friend told her the seller ""just stood there looking confused"".
Ms Morton-Humphreys, whose sting has gone viral on social media, said she now uses her ""less expensive"" bike to travel around Bristol.
She also said she was more worried about her bike's safety when she came face to face with the culprits, in case it was vandalised.","Jenni Morton-Humphreys, from Bristol, found her bike on social media. She met and tricked the culprit to get it back. She said: ""I cycled on the pavement, fell off a curb, and hit my head pretty hard. When I regained consciousness, my bike was gone. I reported the theft to the police, but they didn't hold out much hope of finding it.""

Determined not to let the thief get away with it, Jenni took matters into her own hands. She posted a picture of her stolen bike on a local Facebook group, along with a plea for help in locating it. Little did she know that this social media post would lead her directly to the culprit.

A few days later, Jenni received a message from a man claiming to have purchased her bike unknowingly. He sent her a picture of the bike, confirming that it was indeed hers. Jenni hatched a plan to retrieve her stolen property.

She arranged a meeting with the man at a nearby park, under the guise of discussing the bike's price. However, instead of bringing money, Jenni brought a friend and a spare key for her bike lock. She devised a clever scheme to outwit the thief.

As she and her friend approached the park, they noticed the man standing by the bike. With adrenaline rushing through her veins, Jenni pretended to be interested in buying the bike, engaging the thief in a conversation about its features and condition.

While the man was busy boasting about the bike's speed and durability, Jenni's friend discreetly unlocked the bike using the spare key. Without missing a beat, Jenni mounted the bike and swiftly rode away, leaving the stunned thief in disbelief.

Jenni later recounted her thrilling experience, stating, ""I knew I needed to be clever about it, so I came up with this plan. Once I had my bike back, I couldn't believe I pulled it off. It felt like a victory against the odds.""

Jenni encourages others who have fallen victim to theft to take a proactive stance. She believes social media can be a powerful tool for recovering stolen items, as it connects the community and"
"The 29-year-old Northampton hooker, who has been banned for a total of 54 weeks, has succeeded Chris Robshaw as captain for the Six Nations.
""The captaincy thing, the whole media circus - the sideshow that I don't really want to do but I understand that I have got to do - and everyone wanting to see me muck up is making me prepared for this game in a good way,"" he said.
England coach Eddie Jones, who replaced Stuart Lancaster after the World Cup, made Hartley his captain, demoting Robshaw, who also starts at Murrayfield in the Six Nations opener.
""Everyone wants to see people fail, don't they?"" said Hartley. ""I just know it is out there, for whatever reason.
""It's my fault, I've created this story. But it isn't something I look back at. I'm pretty excited to be here. I'm prepared and not overplaying it.""
Conor O'Shea, director of rugby at Harlequins, told BBC Radio 5 live he has been urging Robshaw to concentrate on his rugby and not dwell on the captaincy issue.
""I told him to stop apologising about things, be proud of what you've done and go back and prove what you are... the best back-row forward in England and Europe for some time,"" said O'Shea.
""I'm sure there are a few snipers who'll want to try to have a go at him again because he's an easy target. But Chris, for his whole life, has reacted to adversity.
""He's an incredible role model for people. I hope he's man of the match this weekend playing at six, where he's played for us for a number of years.""","The 29-year-old Northampton hooker, who has been banned for a total of 54 weeks, has succeeded Chris Robshaw as captain for the Six Nations.

""But I'm incredibly honored to be given this opportunity and I'm really looking forward to leading the team in the Six Nations.""

The 29-year-old has faced controversy in the past, including being banned for a total of 54 weeks for eye gouging and biting incidents. However, his on-field performances cannot be ignored, and he has proven himself to be a key player for both club and country.

""I understand that there will be some criticisms and doubts surrounding my appointment as captain,"" he admitted. ""But I've learned from my mistakes and I'm fully committed to leading the team in a positive manner.""

The Northampton hooker will have big shoes to fill, as he takes over from Chris Robshaw, who has been a respected leader for the national side. Robshaw stepped down from the captaincy after the World Cup, leaving a void that the new captain aims to fill.

""I have a great deal of respect for Chris and everything he's achieved as captain,"" the hooker acknowledged. ""But I believe in my abilities and I'm excited to take on this new challenge.""

The Six Nations is a highly competitive tournament, and the new captain will be under pressure to perform both as a leader and as a player. However, he remains focused and determined to give his all for the team.

To his surprise, he found a group of people huddled around something on the ground, whispering in hushed tones. As he got closer, Andrew realized that it was a small cat, lying injured and trembling. Without hesitation, he knelt down to assess the cat's condition.

The poor creature's fur was matted with blood, and it seemed to be struggling to breathe.

Determined to help in any way he could, he gently picked up the injured feline and carried it back into the shop.

Inside, Andrew laid the cat on a soft blanket he had brought from his van. He grabbed his phone and dialed the emergency veterinarian clinic, explaining the situation and asking for immediate assistance. The clinic instructed him to keep the cat as calm as possible while they arranged transportation.

As they waited for the vet to arrive, Andrew comforted the cat, softly speaking to it and offering it water from a small dish. The injured feline seemed to respond to his gentle touch, its eyes momentarily closing as if feeling some relief from the pain.

"The charity is calling for more to be done to tackle inequality which it says is an important factor when it comes to people taking their own lives.
The most recent figures show that almost 700 Scots took their own lives over a 12-month period.
The Samaritans report highlights the role played by inequality.
It said poor housing, debt and bleak employment prospects were all factors in the suicide rate being three times higher among the most deprived 10th of the population compared with the least deprived 10th (22.1 deaths per 100,000 population compared with 7.3).
In 2015, 672 people took their own lives in Scotland.
The report, ""Dying from Inequality"", highlights clear areas of risk to communities and individuals, including the closure and downsizing of businesses, those in manual, low-skilled employment, those facing unmanageable debt and those with poor housing conditions.
Samaritans' chief executive Ruth Sutherland said: ""Suicide is an inequality issue which we have known about for some time. This report says that's not right, it's not fair and it's got to change.
""Most important of all is that for the first time this report sets out what needs to happen to save lives.
""Addressing inequality would remove the barriers to help and support where it is needed most and reduce the need for it in the first place.
""Government, public services, employers, service providers, communities, family and friends all have a role in making sure help and support are relevant and accessible when it matters most.""
James Jopling, executive director for Samaritans in Scotland, said: ""Everyone can feel overwhelmed at times in their life. Those who are at risk of suicide are people that have employers, who seek help at job centres, go to their GP, people that come into contact with national and local government agencies, perhaps on a daily basis.
""So in the light of this report we are asking key people and organisations from across society in Scotland to take action to make sure their service, their organisation, their community are doing all they can to promote mental health and prevent the tragedy of suicide.
""Each suicide statistic is a person, with or without family, friends, community, colleagues. This report is a call for us as individuals to care more and for organisations that can make a difference, to do so.""
In Inverclyde, which has the highest suicide rate of any local authority in Scotland, the local Samaritans branch attend homeless lunches, providing support to the most vulnerable in the community who often have complex needs.
Samaritans has already started addressing some of the inequalities driving people to suicide.
It now plans to hold discussions with relevant agencies.
Alison Watson, deputy director of Shelter Scotland, said: ""All too often our services see people who have run out of hope as they cope with homelessness and the reasons behind it such as relationship breakdown, redundancy or low income.
""In the long term we need a co-ordinated effort to end the shortage of affordable homes but right now we need to see targeted investment in the services which support people when they are at their most vulnerable.
""With council budgets under pressure it is important that services for people who have lost their homes are protected as these are undoubtedly a lifeline for many.""
If you are feeling emotionally distressed and would like details of organisations which offer advice and support, go online to bbc.co.uk/actionline or you can call for free, at any time to hear recorded information 0800 066 066.","The charity is calling for more to be done to tackle inequality which it says is an important factor when it comes to people taking their own lives. The most recent statistics show a disturbing increase in suicide rates, particularly among marginalized and disadvantaged communities. The charity emphasizes that addressing inequality is crucial in preventing such tragic outcomes.

According to the charity, inequality contributes significantly to the vulnerability of individuals to suicidal ideation and self-harm. Factors such as limited access to healthcare, education, employment opportunities, and social support can severely impact an individual's mental well-being. Discrimination and prejudice also play a significant role in exacerbating feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and isolation.

The charity is calling for a multi-faceted approach to tackle the issue of inequality and its link to suicide. They recommend addressing structural inequalities through policy changes that ensure equal access to resources and opportunities for all individuals. This includes investment in mental health services and support networks, as well as initiatives to reduce discrimination and promote inclusivity.

Additionally, the charity highlights the importance of community-based interventions that foster social connection, support, and empowerment. This includes creating safe spaces for individuals to share their experiences and struggles, as well as promoting education and awareness campaigns to reduce stigma surrounding mental health.

The charity stresses that tackling inequality and its impact on mental health requires collaboration between governments, policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations. By addressing the underlying causes of inequality and implementing targeted interventions, society can work towards preventing suicide and providing better support for those at risk."
"Gordon Anglesea, 79, from Old Colwyn, was convicted of one charge of indecent assault against one boy and three indecent assaults against another.
The offences took place between 1982 and 1987, when both boys were 14 or 15.
Jailing him at Mold Crown Court on Friday, Judge Geraint Walters said Anglesea ""grossly abused"" the trust placed in him by the boys.
""The consequences for them has been profound, indeed life changing,"" he added.
Anglesea's defence said custody would be ""extremely difficult"" for him.
During the six-week trial, the court heard one boy was abused in the showers of a Home Office attendance centre in Wrexham run by Anglesea, who was a police superintendent at the time.
Eleanor Laws QC, for the prosecution, told the court one of Anglesea's victims had tried to kill himself.
In a victim impact statement, he said he tried to commit suicide ""simply because I couldn't bear to live with the memories of what that man did to me"".
Another victim, who was sent to Bryn Alyn care home at the age of 13, described how he had felt fearful of Anglesea even as an adult.
He said: ""Of all my abusers, Anglesea was the worst. He was the one I feared the most.""
Anglesea wiped his eye as he heard one victim had started drinking at the age of 14 and had been an alcoholic all of his adult life.
North Wales Police Chief Constable Mark Polin apologised to the victims whose lives Anglesea had ""traumatically affected"".
Mr Polin said Anglesea had abused a position of power and trust and his actions were ""reprehensible"" and ""unacceptable"".
He told BBC Wales that while it had taken a ""long time"" for justice to be served, there was no evidence of any misconduct or systemic failings by the force.
""I expect abusers in north Wales and elsewhere to be looking over their shoulders for the rest of their lives, I think time has caught up with Gordon Anglesea,"" he said.
Roy McComb, National Crime Agency deputy director for specialist investigations, said Anglesea abused children who ""should have been safe in his presence"".
Ed Beltrami, chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, said the sentence was a ""testament"" to the fortitude of those who came forward.
Anglesea was arrested in 2013 as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial investigation into historical abuse across north Wales.
Tania Griffiths, defending, argued Anglesea had not had a fair trial and the verdicts were ""perverse"" and ""unsafe"".
He was also found not guilty of an alternative charge of a serious sexual assault.
In 1994, Anglesea was awarded Â£375,000 in libel damages after media organisations ran stories about his links to abuse at children's homes in north Wales.
He is expected to appeal against the conviction.
NSPCC Wales said Anglesea had ""robbed his victims of their childhoods"".","Gordon Anglesea, 79, from Old Colwyn, was convicted of one charge of indecent assault against one boy and three indecent assaults against another. The offences took place between 1982 and 1986, when the victims were teenagers. Anglesea was a retired police superintendent at the time of his arrest in 2016. The court heard that he had used his position of authority to exploit the vulnerability of the boys and abuse them. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his crimes. The case gained significant attention due to Anglesea's prominent and respected position within the police force. It highlighted the issue of institutional abuse and the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions."
"The 23-year-old, in his eighth Test, was dropped three times but reached an entertaining hundred from 104 balls.
England claimed two wickets in five balls early on but left-hander De Kock shared in stands of 50 and 82 and was unbeaten on 129 as his team made 475.
In reply Alex Hales fell cheaply but Alastair Cook held firm with 67.
South Africa resumed on 329-5 with De Kock on 29 and added 146 runs in 42 overs before they were bowled out midway through the afternoon session.

Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada claimed two early England wickets, trapping Nick Compton for 19 with one that pitched halfway down the wicket but hit barely above the boots.
The increasingly uneven bounce will give South Africa, who have already lost the series, hope of a consolation victory.
England's new opener Hales, playing his seventh Test innings, struck three fluent boundaries in his 15 from 14 balls, with consecutive attractive strokes to the fence through the off-side off the back foot.
But in the sixth over he skewed a loose drive, which was comfortably caught at backward point.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special: ""It was a terrible dismissal. He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures.
""He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive.""
Hales, who has passed 50 only once in seven innings in the series, is the eighth opening partner for Cook since the retirement of former skipper Andrew Strauss in 2012.
The current captain showed a welcome return to form, however, looking assured in his first fifty of the series - and the 47th of his Test career - and is only 50 short of becoming the first England player to score 10,000 Test runs.
Joe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss.
Having reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total.
In only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance.
On 80, De Kock edged the luckless Chris Woakes and bisected wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and wide first slip Alastair Cook, neither of whom went for the catch.
Ten runs later, De Kock's drive at Moeen Ali went through the hands of Cook at short extra-cover.
The left-hander played an array of shots all around the wicket and was particularly severe on Moeen Ali.
He scored 45 runs off the spinner in only 28 balls, including two mighty leg-side sixes, one of which nearly landed on a cameraman behind the long-on boundary.
Former South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher: ""The pitch is not going to get any better; those cracks are going to widen. Batting from now on is going to be hard graft. In the last innings it will be a real lottery.
""You do feel that if South Africa get it right in a session, they will do some proper damage. You could have a session where England go 60-4.""
Ex-England skipper Michael Vaughan: ""There's going to be more low bounce over the next three days. You're under a lot of pressure when a team gets 475 on the board - you're only one bad session away from losing the match.
""If England get out of this Test with something, they'll have done brilliantly.""","The 23-year-old, in his eighth Test, was dropped three times but reached an entertaining hundred from 104 balls. England claimed two wickets in five balls early on but left-hander De jae nailed the attack with his aggressive stroke play. He displayed great maturity and composure, especially considering the dropped catches, and remained unperturbed by the early setbacks.

His century was a testament to his immense talent and potential. In just his eighth Test match, he showcased his ability to dominate the opposition and took the game away from England with his attacking approach. Scoring a hundred in such a quick time, from just 104 balls, was a testament to his aggressive intent and ability to score runs at a quick pace.

England had some early success, picking up two wickets in five balls. However, Dejae's arrival at the crease changed the dynamics of the game. He played a flurry of attacking shots, dispatching the bowlers to all parts of the ground. His left-handedness added to the challenge for the English bowlers, who struggled to contain him.

The fact that he was dropped three times further emphasized his dominance. It was a stroke of luck for him, but he capitalized on the opportunities and made the English pay for their mistakes. His innings was not only entertaining but also demoralizing for the opposition, as they were unable to dismiss him despite having multiple chances.

Dejae's hundred was a match-defining innings that turned the game in his team's favor. His aggressive stroke play shifted the momentum and put pressure on the England bowlers. It was a display of immense skill and character, and it announced his arrival on the international stage.

Overall, Dejae's century was a treat to watch. It showcased his potential and provided a glimpse into what he can achieve in the future. At just 23 years old, he already possesses the ability to dominate Test matches and entertain audiences with his aggressive batting style. He will undoubtedly be a player to watch out for in the upcoming matches and series."
"More than 2,450 drugs tests will be done at the Sochi Winter Olympics, up from 2,149 at Vancouver 2010.
""We don't seem to be rife with match-fixing and illegal betting but doping is a problem,"" Reedie told BBC Radio.
""I think we can win battles, I question whether we can ever win the war. But the more battles we win, hopefully the more people we will discourage.""
If they're not clean, they're not welcome
The International Olympic Committee said on Sunday that Sochi 2014 will have the ""most stringent anti-doping programme"" seen at a Winter Olympics.
That announcement came three days after Russian biathlete Irina Starykh pulled out of the Games after a positive test.
And Reedie, who began his role last month, hopes enhanced testing procedures will deter athletes from contemplating the use of illegal substances.
""There has been a pretty wide-ranging unannounced pre-competition testing programme, and I suspect that is the one that has caught the Russian biathlete,"" he told the BBC's Dan Walker.
Athletes' samples will be kept after the Games should technology further improve and allow for future testing.
""Sometime over the next eight years they will be looking at selected samples as science and technology gets better, so athletes who think they can get away with it now may not get away with it in the future,"" said Reedie.
""I wish it didn't happen but it is the world in which we live. It is, I think, the biggest threat facing Olympic sport.""
The 72-year-old Scot wants athletes to know ""if they're not clean, they're not welcome"".
He added: ""It has to be an element of deterrence by testing. There also has to be a very significant effort of education, and philosophically we have to get all of the athletes to understand we are in business to protect the clean athletes.""
The Sochi 2014 opening ceremony takes place on 7 February, with the first events taking place the day before.","More than 2,450 drugs tests will be done at the Sochi Winter Olympics, up from 2,149 at Vancouver 2010. ""We don't seem to be rife with match-fixing and illegal betting problems like some other major sporting events, but we cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to ensuring clean competition,"" said Dmitry Chernyshenko, the President of the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee. The increased number of drugs tests reflects the commitment of the Olympic authorities to maintain fairness and integrity in the games.

The Sochi Winter Olympics will implement a comprehensive and sophisticated anti-doping program to prevent athletes from using prohibited substances or methods to enhance their performance. This program includes both in-competition and out-of-competition testing, targeting a wide range of substances and techniques.

The tests will be conducted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in collaboration with national anti-doping organizations. Athletes will be subject to random testing, and medal winners will undergo mandatory testing.

In addition to urine and blood samples, the anti-doping program will also include targeted testing for specific substances that are common in winter sports, such as erythropoietin (EPO) and growth hormone. The samples will be analyzed at certified laboratories using state-of-the-art technology to ensure accurate and reliable results.

Athletes who test positive for banned substances may face disciplinary action, including disqualification, loss of medals, and bans from future competitions. The goal of the anti-doping program is not only to catch cheaters but also to deter athletes from resorting to doping in the first place.

By increasing the number of drugs tests at the Sochi Winter Olympics, the organizers aim to send a clear message that they are committed to fair play and maintaining the integrity of the games. The efforts to prevent and detect doping reflect the importance of upholding the principles of equality, sportsmanship, and clean competition in international sporting events."
"The books, about Henry VIII's adviser Thomas Cromwell, are being adapted by Peter Straughan who co-wrote the 2011 film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow said the channel was ""very fortunate"" to have the rights to the two novels.

Wolf Hall was propelled into the bestseller lists after winning the Booker Prize in 2009.
It tells the fictionalised account of Cromwell's rise and fall in the Tudor Court.
Its sequel Bring Up The Bodies, which focuses on Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn, has been longlisted for this year's prize.
The shortlist will be announced on 11 September.

The Spaniard won 6-3 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 in almost five hours to reach a first Grand Slam final since 2014.
Dimitrov's wait to reach a maiden Slam final continues after Nadal, 30, inflicted his first defeat of the year.
Nadal, who is attempting to win a 15th major title, will face Swiss rival Federer, 35, in Melbourne on Sunday.
""I never dreamed to be back in the final of the Australian Open,"" said Nadal.
""It is a very special thing for both of us to be playing again in a major final. Neither of us probably thought we would be here again.""
He will meet Federer, who needed five sets to beat compatriot Stan Wawrinka in Thursday's first semi-final, in Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena at 08:30 GMT.
As well as an extra day's rest, 17-time Grand Slam winner Federer spent almost two hours less on court than Nadal during his semi-final, having beaten Wawrinka in a comparatively quick three hours and five minutes.
Twenty four hours later, both Nadal and Dimitrov showed incredible endurance in a match during which neither man looked like wilting.
That's right up there with the best matches I've ever seen
Eventually the 25-year-old Bulgarian buckled first - losing his serve at 4-4 in the deciding set - as Nadal wrapped up victory with his third match point at almost 00:45 local time.
Nadal dropped to his knees at the baseline in celebration, bringing a charged Rod Laver Arena to its feet, when Dimitrov sent a forehand long.
His victory means all four singles finalists are aged 30 or over, with 35-year-old Serena Williams meeting sister Venus, 36, in the women's final on Saturday.
Much of the talk before Friday's second semi-final centred around the prospect of Nadal meeting Federer for the ninth time in a Grand Slam final.
The pair dominated the men's game between 2004 and 2010, before Novak Djokovic's emergence, and have provided many memorable duels over the past 13 years.
However, few would have suggested a fortnight ago they would be reunited in the first major final of 2017.
Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide.
Federer is making his competitive return in Melbourne after six months out with a knee injury, while Nadal has also struggled with form and injury over the past couple of years.
But both men have disproved the notion the combination of ageing bodies and physical problems would prevent them from challenging again for major honours.
Nadal showed few signs of fatigue in his marathon win against Dimitrov, just as Federer did not when he overcame compatriot Wawrinka in Thursday's semi-final.
Now they have been rewarded with their first Slam showpiece since the French Open in 2011.

Dimitrov received a standing ovation as he left the Rod Laver Arena, though it was probably scant consolation after failing to become the first Bulgarian to reach a major final.
Once dubbed 'Baby Fed' for his similarity in playing style to Federer, he showed enough against Nadal to suggest he will end that unwanted record soon.
However, it is difficult to pinpoint what more he could have done.
Dimitrov showed he has the tools needed to compete with the best players - thumping down 20 aces to Nadal's eight, cracking 79 winners to Nadal's 45 and showing extraordinary defensive resilience.
It was still too little against an inspired Nadal.
The Spaniard showed remarkable physical and mental strength to overcome Dimitrov and is now one win away from becoming the first man to win the double career Grand Slam in the Open era.
American great John McEnroe said Nadal's win over Dimitrov was one of the best matches he had ever seen, while two-time Australian Open finalist Pat Cash described it as a ""rollercoaster"".
Breaks of serve, swings of momentum all over the place. Here's how the memorable match unfolded:

"Two local residents have raised the flags ahead of the US presidential hopeful's visit to Scotland later this week.
They said they wanted to ""show solidarity"" with the people of Mexico.
It comes after Mr Trump outlined plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border to stop illegal immigrants.
Trump International Golf Links was opened by the businessman in 2012, after a lengthy battle with local people and environmentalists.
One of the flags has been raised by Michael Forbes, who refused to sell his land on the Menie Estate to Mr Trump before the course opened.
A second flag is being flown alongside a Saltire by David Milne, who lives in a former coastguard station overlooking the 18-hole course.
Mr Trump will return to Scotland on Friday to officially open the revamped Turnberry course in Ayrshire, which he also owns.
He is also expected to visit the Aberdeenshire course during his trip to Scotland.
Mr Milne said: ""I am currently flying a Mexican flag along with my usual Saltire just for solidarity along with those worldwide who Trump has decried, insulted and threatened over the years, and will continue to decry, insult and threaten.""
He said there were no plans to hold a protest during Mr Trump's visit.
""We don't think he's worth the effort,"" he said.
But he said the flag would be visible from the clubhouse.
""It's just enough to remind him that where he tried to drive us out he failed completely on that front.""","Two local residents have raised the flags ahead of the US presidential hopeful's visit to Scotland later this week. They said they wanted to ""show solidarity"" with the people of the United States and express their support for the presidential candidate.

The residents hope their gesture will send a positive message to the candidate and show that there is support for their campaign even in a foreign country. This act of solidarity highlights the global impact of the United States' presidential elections and emphasizes the importance of international relations in today's interconnected world."
"The Englishman, 40, took the last two frames, sealing victory with a break of 55 to claim his first ranking title since the 2015 World Championship.
Bingham had led 4-0 in the early stages and came through a scrappy final session that saw a highest break of 63.
""Unbelievable,"" said the world number two. ""To get my hands on another trophy means everything.""
Compatriot Trump, 27, cut the early deficit to 5-3 by taking the last frame of the afternoon session and moved 7-6 and 8-7 ahead in the evening.
However, Bingham got back on level terms and, after Trump missed an early opportunity in the decider, it was the former world champion who prevailed with a clearance.
""I honestly felt that Judd outclassed me from the word go,"" said Bingham. ""The first two frames were massive but it was only from his mistake that I cleared up and won.
""I've been knocking on the door since October, playing pretty well. I thought it wasn't going to happen here and hats off to Judd, from 4-0 down a lot of people would have crumbled and given up.""
Trump said: ""It was tough. I missed a few chances early on. I kind of threw it away in the first four frames.
""I missed too many easy balls and even tonight when I was getting back into it, I missed another easy ball. On the whole I did well to get back into it, it was just the odd shot here and there that cost me.""","The Englishman, 40, took the last two frames, sealing victory with a break of 55 to claim his first ranking title since the 2015 World Championship. Bingham had led 4-0 at the start of the match, but his opponent fought back fiercely, winning the next four frames to level the score. The tension in the arena was palpable as the players entered the final stages of the match.

With both players showcasing their skills and determination, it was evident that every shot carried immense weight. The Englishman displayed nerves of steel as he executed a flawless break of 55 in the last two frames, securing his victory and the coveted ranking title.

For Bingham, this win marked a triumphant return to the pinnacle of his sport after a four-year drought. The former World Champion demonstrated his resilience and ability to perform under pressure, ultimately emerging victorious against a formidable opponent.

As the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, Bingham basked in the glory of his achievement, knowing that his relentless hard work and unwavering dedication had finally paid off. This victory not only rekindled his competitive spirit but also solidified his place among the brightest stars in the snooker world.

With his first ranking title in years, Bingham now sets his sights on future tournaments, aiming to continue his success and build on this remarkable comeback. The Englishman's remarkable journey serves as a testament to his passion for the game and his unwavering belief in himself."
"Stuart Jefferson, 32, was accused of setting a fire at the former Majestyk nightclub in City Square on the night of 30 September.
He admitted being inside the building on the night of the fire but denied two counts of arson.
The jury at Leeds Crown Court heard Mr Jefferson had two previous convictions for arson.
During the three-day trial, the court heard that staff and guests at the Quebec Hotel next door to the venue had to be evacuated during the fire.
Evidence collected after the blaze showed a naked flame had been deliberately placed against the seats.
Dozens of firefighters tackled the blaze at the Grade-II listed building, the home of the Majestic cinema in the 1920s.

He admitted being inside the building on that night but denied starting the fire. Jefferson's lawyer argued that there was no evidence directly linking his client to the arson, and claimed that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

During the trial, several witnesses testified that they saw Jefferson leaving the building shortly before the fire started. However, the defense argued that these witnesses had a biased view of the events and could not accurately identify Jefferson as the culprit.

The prosecution presented surveillance footage from nearby cameras, showing a man who resembled Jefferson entering and leaving the building around the time of the fire. They also presented forensic evidence, including traces of accelerant found at the scene, which they claimed matched samples taken from Jefferson's clothing.

However, the defense challenged the reliability"

"At the end of September, 16.3% (39,557) of patients were waiting more than a year for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment.
The Health and Social Care Board described the figures as ""unacceptable"".
A plan to tackle the delays is expected to be announced in January.
The latest Department of Health figures show a total of 243,141 patients in Northern Ireland were waiting for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment at the end of September.
That is 7% more (17,548) than at the end of June and 5.4% (12,516) more than at 30 September last year.
Analysis by BBC News NI Health Correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly
The fact that hospital waiting times are up comes as no surprise.
The number of people living longer and requiring specialist health services is increasing - but that is not matched by either funding or extra staff.
As with the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has a shortage of specialist staff.
Take radiology - at the moment there are about 40 vacant radiologist posts. That has a massive knock-on effect when it comes to seeing people on time.
There is also a shortage of specialist orthopaedic surgeons - hence the number of people waiting for hip replacements and back surgery.
In January, the health minister is due to announce a plan as to how she envisages tackling hospital waiting lists.
That is expected to include a detailed strategy and additional dedicated resources.
But it is hardly likely that those resources will solve the problem.
Instead, the health service will have to do things differently, including consultants changing how they work and being prepared to allow GPs and nurses to share the workload.
In the Northern Health Trust for instance, dermatology consultants are being encouraged to view photographs of patients and their complaint rather than insisting on seeing everyone in person.
Something radical needs to happen to shatter this cycle of men and women waiting unacceptable times on lists.
According to targets set by the health minister, at least 50% of patients should not have to wait any longer than the recommended nine-week target.
More than two thirds of patients in Northern Ireland (167,250) were waiting more than nine weeks for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment, according to the latest Department of Health figures. That is a slight increase compared to the same time last year.
At the end of September, more than 70,000 patients were waiting to be admitted to hospital. That is an increase of 11.7% on last year.","At the end of September, 16.3% (39,557) of patients were waiting more than a year for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment. The Health and Social Care Board described the figures as ""unacceptable"" and acknowledged the need for urgent action. They expressed concern over the significant number of patients experiencing long waiting times for their initial appointments with consultant-led outpatient services. The board recognized that these delays could have detrimental effects on patients' health and urged concerted efforts to address the issue promptly.

The figures suggest that a considerable portion of the population is facing extended waits for specialist care, potentially resulting in delayed diagnoses and treatment plans. This situation may lead to increased discomfort, reduced quality of life, and exacerbation of health conditions for these individuals.

The Health and Social Care Board recognized the urgency of the matter and emphasized the importance of prioritizing resources and implementing strategies to reduce waiting times. They acknowledged the need for collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to work towards improving access to timely care for all patients.

Overall, the Health and Social Care Board's response indicates their acknowledgment of the severity of the issue and their commitment to taking necessary measures to address and rectify the current situation."
"The first Project Ara hardware was due to be trialled in Puerto Rico this year, but has been pushed back to at least 2016.
The trial will take place in a new location in the US, the Project Ara team said via a series of tweets.
The team blamed ""lots of iterations"" in the design, which was first shown off in 2013, for the delay.
Project Ara is Google's intriguing attempt at creating a smartphone that comes in bits.
It means certain components can be added or taken away without the need for intricate alterations to the phone.
It would potentially mean smashed screens or worn batteries would be less costly to replace - as well as allowing others to create bespoke hardware for specific tasks.
Google had planned to offer around 20 to 30 different modules for the Puerto Rico trial.
In a series of tweets, the team told followers that ""#Project Ara isn't going anywhere"", but said it had been set back by ""Lots of iterationsâ€¦ more than we thought"".
The first public demonstration of the technology, at Google's I/O developers conference in May, was well-received.
Writing on a forum for developers interested in working on Project Ara, San Francisco based designer Garrett Kinsman said he felt a ""sense of overwhelming sadness"" at the delay.

"The Seasiders took the lead after 15 minutes from the penalty spot. Jordan Flores' floating cross was adjudged to have been handled by Stevenage skipper Jack King, and Mark Cullen stepped up to convert.
Stevenage should have levelled after 39 minutes, when Dean Lyness produced a great save with his feet to deny King from six yards, before the defender then blasted over from the rebound.
But the visitors were grateful to Luke Wilkinson after 43 minutes, as he produced a superb goalmouth block to keep out Colin Daniel's close-range strike.

Substitution, Blackpool. Ian Black replaces Brad Potts because of an injury.
Attempt missed. Tom Pett (Stevenage) left footed shot from outside the box is too high.","The Seasiders took the lead after 15 minutes from the penalty spot. Jordan Flores' floating cross was adjudged to have been handled by Stevenage skipper Jack King, and Mark Cullen stepped up to confidently slot the ball into the bottom corner, giving Blackpool the early advantage. The penalty decision caused controversy among the Stevenage players and fans, who felt that the handball was unintentional.

Despite the setback, Stevenage quickly regrouped and started to put pressure on the Blackpool defense. Their efforts paid off in the 30th minute when Charlie Carter capitalized on a defensive error and slotted the ball past the Blackpool goalkeeper to equalize.

The rest of the first half was evenly contested, with both teams creating chances but failing to convert them into goals. The score remained level at 1-1 heading into the halftime break.

The second half saw Blackpool regain control of the game, with their midfield duo of Jordan Flores and Mark Cullen dictating the tempo. Their efforts were rewarded in the 65th minute when Liam Feeney delivered a teasing cross into the box, which Cullen met with a powerful header to give Blackpool the lead once again.

Stevenage pushed forward in search of an equalizer, but their efforts were in vain as the Blackpool defense held firm. The Seasiders ultimately secured a 2-1 victory, much to the delight of their home fans.

The win saw Blackpool climb up the league table, while Stevenage were left to rue their missed opportunities. Both teams can take positives from the game, with Blackpool showcasing their attacking prowess and Stevenage displaying resilience in their fightback.

Overall, it was an entertaining clash between the Seasiders and Stevenage, with Blackpool coming out on top thanks to their clinical finishing and solid defensive display."
"Planting Peace, a US-based non-profit group that seeks to ""spread peace in a hurting world"", launched the flag near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 17 August.
The balloon captured video with a GoPro camera as it floated 21.1 miles (34.1km) above earth for three hours.
Organisers said they wanted to declare space gay friendly, ""in a peaceful, beautiful way"".
The balloon and its flag returned to earth, but the episode was captured in striking footage that shows the planet's surface from above, with the sun beaming behind the flag.
The non-profit group said: ""The primary purpose of this declaration is to support the ongoing fight for the fundamental human rights of our LGBTQ [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer] family, moving us closer to a universal understanding that all people deserve to live freely and love freely without fear and discrimination.""
It added that the stunt emphasised the need for the gay community to have a safe space in every corner of the universe.
As well as gay rights activism, Planting Peace runs humanitarian aid projects and environmental initiatives across the world.
It recently made headlines during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, with a billboard that showed US presidential candidate Donald Trump and then-aspiring Republican nominee Ted Cruz poised to kiss, with the slogan ""Love trumps Hate. End homophobia"".

The balloon captured video with a camera attached to it as it reached an altitude of 21.1 miles (33.9 km) before bursting. The footage captured breathtaking views of the Earth from above as the balloon ascended into the stratosphere. The goal of this project was to promote peace and unity by showcasing the beauty and interconnectedness of our planet.

The video featured stunning shots of the Earth's curvature, the thin atmospheric layer surrounding our planet, and the vastness of space. It also provided a unique perspective on human civilization, as cities and landscapes were visible from high above, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all people and the shared responsibility to work towards peace.

Additionally, Planting Peace used this project to raise awareness about important global issues. The nonprofit's president, Aaron Jackson, stated that the mission of the project was to ""remind every person on the planet that we do not need to be divided by borders or boundaries, race or religion, gender or sexuality. We are all in this together."" The flag displayed on the balloon represented the 193 recognised countries, symbolizing the message of unity and inclusivity.

The video gained significant attention on social media, with millions of views and shares. Many people were moved by the breathtaking visuals, and the project, along with Planting Peace's message, resonated with individuals globally.

"In May, a lower court convicted him of culpable homicide and sentenced him to five years in jail for driving over and killing a man sleeping on a pavement.
But the appeals judge ruled there was not enough evidence.
Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars, appearing in more than 80 Hindi films, and has a huge fan following.
It was only when the judge insisted that Salman Khan must be present before the verdict was read out, that the actor hurried to the court in south Mumbai on Thursday, the BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from Mumbai.
""The appeal is allowed and the decision of the trial court is quashed and set aside. Salman Khan is acquitted of all charges,"" news agency AFP quoted the Bombay high court judge Anil Ramchandra Joshi as saying.
The prosecution ""failed to establish [the charges] beyond reasonable doubt"", the judge added.
The actor, surrounded by his family members, broke down after hearing the verdict, the Press Trust of India reported.
He tweeted his thanks to his supporters:
September 2002: Salman Khan's car runs over five people sleeping on a Mumbai street, killing a homeless man and injuring four others
October 2002: Khan charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder - arrested but granted bail
May 2003: Court rejects his plea to drop culpable homicide charge
June 2003: Bombay high court drops culpable homicide charge; Khan is then tried for rash and negligent driving
October 2007: Prime witness, a constable who served in his security detail, dies
March 2015: Khan tells the court he was not drunk and his driver was behind the wheel
May 2015: Khan found guilty, given a five-year jail sentence
Thursday's verdict is the latest twist in a case that began 13 years ago when Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser car veered off the road, killing one man and seriously injuring four others.
During his trial in the lower court, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol.
Now the high court has said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who has since died - was not reliable.
The prosecution is likely to challenge the verdict, reports say.
Khan's clothes stylist, Ashley Robello, met him hours after the Bollywood star was cleared by the high court.
Speaking to the BBC's World Have Your Say programme, Mr Robello said there was a ""sense of relief for him [Khan], his family, his sister"" who fought with him for 13 years.
Meanwhile, #SalmanVerdict has been a top trending topic on Twitter as thousands have expressed their opinion on the ruling.
Some have supported the actor, saying the court's order should be respected:
But others seemed unhappy with the verdict:
And some others resorted to humour to comment on the case:","In May, a lower court convicted him of culpable homicide and sentenced him to five years in jail for driving over and killing a man sleeping on a pavement. But in December, the High Court acquitted him of the charges and overturned his conviction.

The High Court cited lack of sufficient evidence to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They also found inconsistencies in the prosecution's case and raised questions about the reliability of witness testimonies.

The court's decision was met with mixed reactions. The victim's family expressed disappointment and criticized the justice system for failing to deliver justice. They argued that there was enough evidence to prove the accused's guilt.

On the other hand, the accused and his family were relieved and grateful for the court's decision. They maintained his innocence throughout the trial and were finally vindicated.

Following his acquittal, the accused was released from prison and returned to his normal life. The case sparked debates about road safety and the culpability of drivers in such accidents.

Overall, the outcome of the court case brought both relief and disappointment to different parties involved, highlighting the complexities and challenges in delivering justice in such cases."

"While Parisians warily return to the cafes, restaurants and theatres, the mood among young people in this banlieue - less then a 30-minute train-ride away - is a far cry from the fun lifestyle that epitomises the central districts.
Around the Place de la Republique in central Paris, streets away from last Friday's deadly attacks, all the talk is of solidarity. But in Saint Denis, it is different.
Grief, anger and defiance in Paris
French president turns right and upstages opposition
Paris attacks highlight security flaws
""Right, solidarityâ€¦ But don't you think they exaggerate the Paris attacks when there are more Syrians dying everyday?""  This is what I heard in Saint Denis, a multicultural and multi-ethnic place with a population of Africans, Algerians, Indians, Chinese, Turkish and many other backgrounds.
Many here have a ""sans-papiers"" status, without legal status or an ID that would allow them to work.
Crime is rife, with high rates of robbery, drugs offences and murder.
The first thing you notice outside the station is the supermarket trolleys with a little makeshift brazier on top.
Mainly run by African French locals, these are ""mobile shish kebab shops"" on wheels apparently to help them flee police more quickly.
There are no bistros here but there is a variety of restaurants, halal butchers and Maghreb sweets.
Chinese stores sell all types of gadgets while boutiques display glittering, sequined, frilled and lacy nightdresses along the main rue de la Republique.
Celine and her friend Lemea are both 17 and part of the banlieue generation.
When I ask about the Paris attacks, Celine blames French government policy.
""I think there will be a third world war. But France has been asking for it because of its intervention in Syria,"" she says.
""The Paris attacks lasted three hours - but this happens everyday in Syria. And Palestinians are dying, too.
""A quarter of Paris says: 'Pray for the French, pray for Paris' - but they don't do it for Palestinians. They have called for solidarity with the Palestinians for some time - but they did it as if it was fashionable.""
Atek Riles, 19, who works at a halal meat butcher has a similar argument.
Born in Saint Denis, he rarely leaves the area and has little time for the Paris attacks.
""If you look closer at Syria, there are now nearly 250,000 dead there. It is about 160 dead per day. So, I am not shocked by these Paris attacks. They are important, of course. But there is nothing we can do.""
Although his suburb has been caught up in the violence, Atek believes anyone who grows up in Saint Denis is not at risk of being indoctrinated by Islamists.
""Those who become radicalised are mentally weak. I used to get upset by what people said about the banlieues, but now I don't even care. They have their lives, we have ours.""
Residents here see themselves as separate from the rest of Paris. I frequently hear remarks about ""us and them"".
That separation from the rest of French society is highlighted by Nilgul, a 29-year-old ethnic Turkish woman born in Saint Denis.
Much of the anger here dates back to France's war in Algeria from 1954-62, in which at least 60,000 Algerian civilians died, she suggests.
""Their problem is not Paris. The reason they're being radicalised might be their desire to take revenge for their parents,"" she believes.
""But also they are mentally weak. Their weaknesses are being exploited in the name of Islam. They are brainwashed.""
Turkish-born Abdullah shows me the bullet holes in his shop, which was hit last month by a gunman chasing his target.
""Virtually no day passes without incident.""
""This is the most dangerous place in Paris,"" says a Moroccan woman, who works as an Arabic translator at the local police station.
As I head back to the station, the ""mobile kebab shops"" are nowhere to be seen. The spot is now occupied by three policemen.
I ask them to sum up Saint Denis.
""Rotten,"" says one. Then, perhaps regretting his choice of word, he adds: ""Difficult, I would say. In a single word, this place is difficult.""","While Parisians warily return to the cafes, restaurants and theatres, the mood among young people in this banlieue - less then a 30-minute train-ride away - is a far cry from the relaxed atmosphere of the city center. The banlieue, or suburb, is plagued by a sense of disillusionment and frustration, which has only been exacerbated by the recent events in the capital.

For years, this particular banlieue has been marginalized and neglected by the French government. Decades of high unemployment, inadequate public services, and a lack of opportunities have left the youth feeling trapped and forgotten. The social divide between the city and its outskirts has only deepened, leaving many young people feeling alienated and excluded.

The recent terrorist attacks in Paris, while tragic, have also provided a stark reminder of this divide. The banlieue has long been associated with social unrest and pockets of radicalism. Many young people here feel a sense of resentment towards the system that has failed to provide them with a better future.

The reopening of cafes, restaurants, and theatres in Paris is seen by many in the banlieue as another example of the stark contrast between the haves and the have-nots. While Parisians enjoy their leisure activities, the young people in the banlieue continue to struggle with the harsh realities of their daily lives.

There is a pervasive feeling of hopelessness among the youth in the banlieue. The lack of opportunities and prospects for the future, coupled with the persistent socio-economic hardships, has created a breeding ground for frustration and anger. The recent events in Paris have only reinforced their sense of marginalization and isolation.

However, despite these challenges, there is also a strong sense of resilience and determination among the young people. Many are actively working towards improving their circumstances and fighting against the obstacles that have been imposed on them. Grassroots organizations and community initiatives have emerged, aiming to provide support and create opportunities for the banlieue youth.

As Parisians cautiously embrace a return to normalcy, it is crucial to acknowledge the stark contrast that exists just a short train ride away. The mood among young people in this banlieue may be a far cry from that of the city center, but their experiences and realities offer important insights into the social and economic inequalities that persist in French society. Addressing these issues is not only a matter of social justice but also a crucial step towards building a more inclusive and harmonious future for all."
"Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome.
Having said that, it wasn't an unmitigated disaster. Every poll throughout the campaign put the Conservatives ahead - and that was indeed the result.
The final polls were fairly accurate about the Conservative and Lib Dem shares. It was Labour where they were uniformly wrong. They also overestimated UKIP and the SNP.
Survation were closest to the actual result. Kantar Public's numbers were also reasonably good.
YouGov's final poll, like most of the others, seriously underestimated Labour. Prior to that, they had been suggesting a closer race. They also had a separate seat projection model which had been indicating a hung parliament. That had been met with a lot of scepticism but, with hindsight, was pretty accurate.
In the final weeks of the campaign, the polls were often criticised for being ""all over the place"". It's true that they were pointing to very different outcomes.
That variation clearly made it difficult to interpret what they were saying. It's surely better, though, that they had different numbers than that they were all wrong in exactly the same way. If you're looking for consistent accuracy then opinion polls are probably not for you.
Pollsters are also sometimes accused of herding - deliberately manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. That accusation can't be levelled at this election.
In 2015 the polls went wrong because their samples were not representative of the electorate - they contained too many Labour voters. They also failed to estimate the difference in turnout rates between different age groups - they overestimated turnout among young voters.
The pollsters who were furthest from the actual result this time were those, like ICM and ComRes, who had taken the strongest measures to try to rectify the problem from 2015. Survation made no significant changes to their methodology and came out on top.
It looks as though the errors this time were caused, at least in part, by fighting the last war.
We'll never know the exact figures for turnout among young voters - it's a secret ballot remember - but YouGov's post-election estimate puts it at 57% for 18-19 year olds and 59% for 20-24 year olds.
That's lower than for older voters but considerably higher than estimates for young voters in 2015.
We can also see that the places where the number of voters increased the most were generally those with young populations. The assumption made by some pollsters that young turnout would continue to under-perform was probably wrong.","Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome of the election. The polls conducted in the final days leading up to the election consistently pointed towards a solid Conservative lead, with some even suggesting a landslide victory for the party. However, the actual election results revealed a narrower margin between the Conservatives and the Labour Party than anticipated.

There are several reasons for this discrepancy between the final polls and the election outcome. One possible factor is the ""Shy Tory"" phenomenon, where some Conservative supporters may have been unwilling to publicly disclose their voting intentions due to social desirability bias or fear of judgment. This phenomenon has been observed in previous elections and can lead to an underestimation of Conservative support in pre-election polling.

Another reason could be the volatility of the political landscape in the UK during this election. The Brexit issue dominated public discourse, and voters' opinions may have shifted significantly during the campaign, making it difficult for pollsters to accurately capture the changing sentiments. Additionally, with the rise of smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party, the dynamics of the election were further complicated, making it challenging for pollsters to accurately predict the outcomes in individual constituencies.

Furthermore, while national-level polls tend to receive more attention, the outcome of the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system is ultimately determined by the performance of parties in individual constituencies. The accuracy of constituency-level polling can vary, and the aggregated results may not always reflect the nuances of specific seat-level contests.

It is worth noting that the element of uncertainty and unpredictability in elections is not unique to the UK. Polls can serve as an indicator of public sentiment, but they are not infallible predictors of election outcomes. The final election results often depend on various factors such as campaign strategies, voter turnout, and regional variations.

Overall, while the final polls suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual election outcome, it is essential to approach pre-election polling with caution and recognize the limitations of such surveys."
"Two carriages crashed on the Smiler ride at the Staffordshire theme park on Tuesday, leaving some passengers trapped for four-and-a-half hours.
Two men, 27 and 18, a woman, 19, and a girl, 17, have suffered serious leg injuries.
Bosses have announced that the park will also be closed on Thursday.
The BBC's Danny Savage said it was understood some of those on the ride sustained ""life-changing injuries"".
Senior paramedic, Peter Howell, said: ""The women's injuries were worst, both suffered open wounds and damaged legs; the two men had leg and chest injuries but were less seriously hurt.""
A fifth person, a man in his 20s with neck and abdominal injuries, was also taken to hospital and another 11 people required medical treatment at the scene.
The 16 were rescued from 25ft (7.6m) up in the air at an angle of about 45 degrees.
How safe are rollercoasters?
Visitors to Alton Towers reported on social media that the ride had broken down earlier in the day. People at the theme park reported hearing ""a loud crash"" when the collision happened.
Asked whether human error could have been a factor in what happened, Nick Varney, chief executive of the park's owners Merlin Entertainments, said it was too early to tell.
""Our business is about giving people memorable experiences with the emphasis on safety and yesterday something dreadful happened,"" he said.
""Those two cars should not have been on the same piece of track. Technically that should not have happened.
""There are braking locks that should stop two cars being on the same section of track and somehow that didn't work the way it was meant to.""
What stops a rollercoaster crashing?
Mr Varney said he could not say when the park would reopen.
Earlier he said: ""I would like to express my sincerest regret and apology to everyone who suffered injury and distress and to their families. The safety of our visitors is our primary concern. ""
Mr Varney said a full investigation was under way and Alton Towers was continuing to work with the emergency services and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
The HSE said it would take action to protect the public if it uncovered ""evidence that could affect the safety of other rides at the park or elsewhere"".
Thorpe Park, Chessington World of Adventures, Legoland Windsor and Drayton Manor Theme Park all said they were carrying out the ""rigorous"" safety checks they perform every day.
David Bromilow, operations manager at Drayton Manor Theme Park, said: ""Every ride undergoes a rigorous daily safety inspection by our experienced maintenance team covering all maintenance and testing before we open the park to our guests.
""As well as the daily inspection and testing, all rides are inspected and verified regularly by independent inspectors in compliance with the HSE guidelines for safe operation.""
Alton Towers' Â£18m Smiler rollercoaster, which boasts a world record 14 loops, has been closed on two occasions because of safety concerns since opening two years ago.
Asked about previous problems with the ride, Mr Varney said he thought there was ""an awful lot of misreporting going on about that"".
""Guest safety on those sorts of incidents is not really a major issue in the sense that when you are on a rollercoaster car, the car can't come off the track. When you have a glitch and the ride stops, it's not really an issue of safety to the riders,"" he said.
Customers with tickets for Wednesday can change them to another day or request a refund through the website.
Asked about the closure, Mr Varney said the park would take ""a more measured view of what's going on and whether it was specific to just the Smiler and then take a view about opening Alton Towers"".
Following their rescue from the ride on Tuesday, the four people who suffered serious injuries were airlifted to major trauma centres.
In total four people were taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital, including one who has since been discharged, and one person - the 27-year-old man with serious leg injuries - was taken to University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.
Five men and six women required medical treatment at the scene.
Following the accident, Merlin Entertainments was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, with its shares down 3%.
The firm, based in Poole, Dorset, has run Alton Towers since buying out previous owner the Tussauds Group in May 2007.

"The decision was taken amid safety fears over the close proximity of the county show to major road junctions.
Red 10 Squadron Leader Mike Ling said the decision was not linked to the Shoreham Airshow vintage jet crash, which killed 11 people last year.
Suffolk Show organisers expressed disappointment over the move, but agreed safety was a priority.

Mr Ling said: ""Even before the tragic events at Shoreham there's always a very in-depth site survey of each display site to make sure it's suitable.
""It just so happens that this site isn't suitable, and people have tried to put two and two together and come out with the fact that it's Shoreham that's made this happen.""
He said they had to take into account built-up areas including the south-east corner of Ipswich, the major junction of the A12/A14, and they could not afford to take any risks.
Suffolk Show director Bill Baker said he was disappointed, but was grateful to the Red Arrows for attempting to bring the aerial display team to the county.
He said: ""If I'm disappointed about anything, it's that the news leaked out and this wasn't all behind closed doors.
""Safety absolutely has to be paramount and I fully respect the decision that's been taken.""","The decision was taken amid safety fears over the close proximity of the county show to major road junctions. Red 10 Squadron Leader Mike Ling said the decision was not taken lightly, but safety was the top priority. Ling explained that with the county show being located so close to major road junctions, there was a heightened risk of accidents and potential dangers to both the pilots and the public.

He further emphasized that the RAF Red Arrows were committed to ensuring the safety of all involved, and a thorough assessment of the situation led to the conclusion that it would be best to cancel the display this year.

Ling also expressed his disappointment at not being able to showcase the team's skills and entertain the spectators, but reiterated that safety had to come first. He assured the public that they would continue to work towards finding alternative ways to engage with them and bring their displays to different parts of the country in the future."
"But now, five years after the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers, we may instead be witnessing the twilight of economic ""neo-leftism"" in Latin America.
The two nations that have embraced it most fervently are Venezuela and Argentina, which have both seen increasing state intervention in their economies.
Despite wide-ranging price controls, they have the highest levels of inflation in the region, amid other serious problems.
And before the end of the year, voters in both countries will have the chance to express their frustrations at the ballot box - although not yet to change their respective governments.
Argentina holds mid-term congressional elections on Sunday, while Venezuela has local elections on 8 December.
After nearly 15 years of the late Hugo Chavez's ""Bolivarian revolution"" - now in the hands of his successor, Nicolas Maduro - Venezuela faces chronic shortages of basic goods, intermittently alleviated by emergency imports from more productive nations.
This week, for example, it was announced that the country is to import Nicaragua's entire crop of black beans for this year.
Nonetheless, the government has accused its political opponents of causing the shortages, as part of what Mr Maduro calls an ""economic war"".
Venezuela has long been Latin America's inflation league leader, but its rate has surged strongly this year and is now close to 50%.
According to some definitions, the country is now entering hyperinflation territory, something last seen in the pre-Chavez days of the 1990s.
All those imports are taking their toll on Venezuela's foreign currency reserves, with just $21.4bn (Â£13.2bn) in the central bank's coffers, the lowest level in nine years.
But the government is making some heroic assumptions about its ability to turn the economy around.
The country's finance minister, Nelson Merentes, drew laughter from opposition politicians this week when he announced his 2014 budget, based on an inflation rate target of between 26% and 28%.
That's roughly equivalent to the ""true"" level of inflation in Argentina, as measured by independent economists, although the government's own discredited figures put it at just 10.6%.
However, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's administration has done its best to make life difficult for those who dissent from the official view.
Her chief enforcer, Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno, has attempted to take legal action against anyone who compiles an alternative inflation index, alleging that the aim is to manipulate the markets by publishing false data.
Mr Moreno is also in charge of forcing Argentina's supermarkets to sell staple goods at artificially frozen prices. Since the beginning of June, 500 products have been subject to price controls.
In July, he went as far as imposing the temporary closure of four supermarkets for not complying fully with the price freeze, although the reason was that they had run out of some of the products, which is what tends to happen when goods are sold at below the market rate.
In fact, as in Venezuela, price controls have tended to provoke shortages of the items affected, including bread, while other basic goods have also been scarce.
In July, Mr Moreno's office issued a statement calling on Argentines not to eat tomatoes for 60 days because of a seasonal shortage.
But the commerce secretary's heavy-handed ways have been catching up with him. Last month, he was formally charged with abuse of power over his efforts to stop the publication of independent inflation figures.
Mr Moreno has always maintained that he was acting within his responsibilities.
But if found guilty, he could be jailed for up to two years and be barred from public office for twice as long.
Argentina and Venezuela are travelling on similar political and economic paths. But Argentina has not suffered as badly.
The country is still expected to register GDP growth of more than 3% this year, while Venezuela appears to be heading for recession again, with negative growth expected for the first time since 2010.
Politically, both countries have leaders struggling to uphold the legacy of an ideological soul mate. While Mr Maduro is the inheritor of the Chavez mantle, Ms Fernandez is following in the footsteps of her late husband, Nestor Kirchner.
But the Argentine president is set to disappear from the political scene at the next election in October 2015, since she is constitutionally barred from running for a third term. With her brand of Peronism expected to do badly in Sunday's polls, she is unlikely to secure the two-thirds majority in Congress that would allow her to quash that ban.
Ms Fernandez has lost popularity since her re-election in October 2011, when she secured 54.1% of the vote. However, recent opinion polls are suggesting she may have regained some sympathy from the electorate after she had surgery to remove a blood clot on her brain earlier this month.
Mr Maduro, for his part, was elected in April and does not have to face the voters again until October 2018. But opinion polls have indicated that if that election were re-run now, his narrow and hotly disputed victory over opposition leader Henrique Capriles would be definitively overturned.
In the meantime, there are signs that both leaders are holding back unpopular measures until after voters go to the polls this year.
Argentina's supermarket price freezes are due to expire at the end of this month, once the mid-term elections are out of the way.
At the same time, the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, still appears overvalued, despite a devaluation in February, when Hugo Chavez was still alive and in power.
In fact, there have been seven devaluations of the bolivar since Venezuela embraced Chavez's ""21st Century socialism"", and analysts are forecasting that there will soon be an eighth - but not until the local elections have taken place.","But now, five years after the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers, we may instead be witnessing the twilight of economic ""neo-leftism"" in Latin America. The two nations that have been at the forefront of this economic ideology, Venezuela and Brazil, are both facing significant economic challenges that threaten to unravel the progress made under the ""pink tide"" that swept the region in the early 2000s.

Venezuela, under the leadership of the late Hugo Chavez and now his successor Nicolas Maduro, embraced a radical form of socialism that sought to redistribute wealth and empower the lower classes. However, years of mismanagement, corruption, and a heavy reliance on oil revenues have left the country in economic ruins. Inflation has skyrocketed, basic goods are scarce, and protests have erupted in the streets as citizens voice their frustration with the government's handling of the crisis.

Brazil, once seen as an economic powerhouse and a shining example of successful left-wing policies, is now grappling with its worst recession in decades. Former president Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016, oversaw a period of economic stagnation and increased government spending. Now, current President Jair Bolsonaro is facing the daunting task of implementing austerity measures to stabilize the economy and reduce the country's massive budget deficit.

These economic challenges facing Venezuela and Brazil are not unique. Other countries in the region, such as Argentina and Ecuador, have also struggled under the weight of economic mismanagement and a decline in commodity prices. The promises of economic equality, social welfare programs, and increased government intervention that were once celebrated have proven unsustainable in the face of global economic realities.

As a result, we are now seeing a shift away from the leftist policies that dominated the region for more than a decade. Governments in Argentina and Ecuador have embraced more market-friendly policies and have sought to attract foreign investment to boost their economies. Chile, which has long been seen as a bastion of free-market capitalism in the region, continues to attract international investors and has weathered economic storms better than its neighbors.

While it is too early to declare the complete demise of economic ""neo-leftism"" in Latin America, the challenges faced by Venezuela and Brazil serve as a reminder of the limitations of this ideology. As countries in the region continue to grapple with economic uncertainty and seek solutions to their problems, we may see a shift towards more pragmatic and balanced economic policies."
"The 39-year-old former world number one is now ranked 96 in the world and without a PGA Tour title since 2012.

He had five birdies to reach eight under at the Harbour Town links.
Donald, four times a runner-up in the tournament, had three consecutive birdies on the front nine and a superb bunker shot to two feet from a precarious plugged lie helped him to save par at the 17th.
He then produced a delicate lofted chip from the right of the 18th fairway that checked and trickled into the cup.
""I've always felt like I pitch the ball really well round here,"" said Donald.
""The grass lends itself to being able to create some spin and I needed it down there - I didn't have much green to work with - it just came off perfectly with a little side spin into the cup.
""I've hit a few poor drives today and I need to work on that. It was a little bit more stressful than I would have liked but a great short game bailed me out.""
De Laet, the world number 128, is still to win on the PGA Tour and has missed four cuts this season, but he eagled the par-four ninth en route to a 67.
Danny Willett, who missed the cut in his defence of the Masters at Augusta, had two double bogeys in a 78 that left him at seven over, and absent for the weekend for a second tournament in succession.
Another Sheffield golfer, Matt Fitzpatrick, who was 32nd at Augusta, also missed the cut after four bogeys and a double bogey in a 72 for a three-over total.
But Scotsman Russell Knox, who missed the cut at Augusta, had four birdies in five holes in a 66 to reach six under, one ahead of England's Tyrrell Hatton.
Andrew 'Beef' Johnston, who has missed the cut in three of his six PGA Tour events this season, is three under after a 71.
Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, winner of this event after a play-off in 2013, is eight shots off the lead after four birdies in a 68.","The 39-year-old former world number one is now ranked 96 in the world and without a PGA Tour title since 2012. But his fifth birdie gave him a four-under 67 and moved him up the leaderboard at the current tournament. Despite his recent struggles, the golfer showed signs of his previous dominance as he finished the round with a strong birdie, putting him in contention for a high finish.

"Northamptonshire Police found Ian Caffel guilty of breaching standards of professional behaviour.
A panel heard he made comments to seven women and had a sexual relationship with a vulnerable colleague between March 2010 and August 2016.
Mr Caffel was not present at the hearing and no mitigation was offered.
He was dismissed without notice.
The hearing, chaired by Chief Constable Simon Edens, was also told Mr Caffel, who had been with the force for almost seven years, had previously received management advice from Bedfordshire Police following an investigation into his conduct with younger female colleagues at that force.
After finding the eight allegations proven, Mr Edens said the evidence had been ""clear and compelling"" and had shown Mr Caffel ""blatantly abused his position"".
""I have no hesitation in concluding that the allegations against Mr Caffel are true,"" he said.
""It is indisputable that he has failed in his duty to maintain the standards expected of him and that he has failed to modify his behaviour following a previous investigation by Bedfordshire Police.
""There is no place for anybody at Northamptonshire Police who behaves in this way.""
Det Supt Mark Behan from the professional standards department said: ""Mr Caffel was held to account by his own employers, demonstrating our commitment to upholding the standards of professional behaviour and the honesty and integrity of our officers and staff.""","Northamptonshire Police found Ian Caffel guilty of breaching standards of professional behaviour. A panel heard he made comments to seven women and had a sexual relationship with a vulnerable colleague Ian Caffel, a police officer from Northamptonshire Police, was found guilty of breaching the standards of professional behavior. A disciplinary panel heard that he had made inappropriate comments to seven women and engaged in a sexual relationship with a vulnerable colleague.

The specific details regarding the nature of the comments and the extent of the relationship were not provided in the given information. However, it is clear that Caffel's actions were considered a breach of professional conduct.

The disciplinary panel likely considered factors such as abuse of authority, potential harm to the vulnerable colleague, and the impact on public trust in their decision. The severity of the consequences would depend on the specific policies and laws governing the police force in question and the overall impact of Caffel's actions.

It is essential for police officers to maintain a high level of professionalism and integrity in their interactions with colleagues and the public. Breaching these standards can have serious consequences, as in this case, where Caffel was found guilty and faced disciplinary action."
"Last week it was Julie Cooper's bill to provide cheap hospital parking for carers; this week the victim was Nick Thomas Symonds' Off Patent Drugs Bill.
In both cases new MPs found themselves flummoxed by the the arcane rules which govern private members bills.
And they're discovering the hard way that it is not enough to have a worthy cause - they need tactical streetsmarts and committed support from a good number of colleagues to get even mildly contentious legislation through.
The key point about Friday sittings is that there is no time limit on MPs speeches.
Once an Hon Member has the floor they can drone on forever, unless they run foul of the chair for deviation or repetition.
It was this that allowed a group of hardline Tory backbenchers plus the Health Minister Alistair Burt to block Julie Cooper.
They talked and talked and talked till the end of business arrived at 2.30pm - and because she did not have 100 MPs behind her, to force through a closure motion, end the debate and trigger a vote on the Second Reading of her Bill, it ran out of time, and (as we say on Today in Parliament) ""now has little chance of becoming law"".
Today the game was played a little differently.
Mr Thomas Symonds had mobilised considerable support, and might have been able to force a closureâ€¦.. But his opponents were clever.
They padded out the debate on Wendy Morton's utterly uncontentious NHS Charities Bill with rambling speeches inspired by the clauses about Great Ormond St Hospital's right to the royalties to Peter Pan.
They droned on till about 1.10, and the tactical mistake was not to cut them off earlier.
Mr Thomas Symonds had tried to take his Second Reading debate at a canter, but ran into an insurmountable obstacle in the form of Health Minister Alistair Burt, who provoked cries of anger when he indicated his intention to keep talking until the 2.30pm cut-off time.
Then supporters tried to end his speech with a closure motion, which requires the support of 100 MPs.
They might have had the numbers - the Chamber certainly became a little more full at that point - but it was never tested because the Chair (Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel) refused to allow the motion to be put.
The Chair never explains its rulings, but the reason was that surely that there had just not been enough debate.
The Second Reading of a full dress Bill needs a decent amount of debate, if it's contentious, as this one clearly was. So debate had to have run on for a couple of hours, at the very least.
To have had enough debate, to make a closure possible, Mr Thomas Symonds supporters should have sought to end the previous debate well before Noon - and given the borderline relevance of much of the stuff about Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, etc, they might have found the Chair sympathetic.
But that didn't happen and so it was always improbable that they would get their wayâ€¦. Both Natascha Engel and more particularly Alistair Burt had a very rough final half hour as angry MPs vented their fury - but both acted within the rules.
All this looks like, and indeed is, very arcane game-playing.
But there are two points here.
First, law-making, creating rules which everyone has to obey, should not be easy.
There has to be a robust scrutiny mechanism between MPs' pet schemes for the progress of mankind and the Statute Book - and the elite cadre of Tory MPs who spend their Fridays in the Chamber talking out bills they don't like see themselves as protecting the public from bad law made in an emotional spasm.
Others, of course, see the bills rather differently, but the awkward squad know the game very well.
Some MPs talk to them in advance to convince them or reach a compromise, and a few can mobilise colleagues to try and over-ride them.
But the second point is that the current rules must look very strange to people outside.
And maybe a better system would be one which brought every bill to a vote - so that those who wanted to kill them had to do so in the sunlight.","Last week it was Julie Cooper's bill to provide cheap hospital parking for carers; this week the victim was Nick Thomas Symonds' Off Patent Drugs Bill. In both cases new legislation was proposed in the UK Parliament to address specific issues within the healthcare system.

Julie Cooper's bill aimed to provide affordable hospital parking for carers, recognizing the financial burden carers often face when visiting their loved ones in hospital. The bill's objective was to ensure that carers can access hospital parking at a reduced cost or for free.

On the other hand, Nick Thomas Symonds' Off Patent Drugs Bill sought to address the issue of high drug prices by making it easier for cheaper generic versions of medications to enter the market. The proposal aimed to promote competition among pharmaceutical companies and increase access to affordable medications for patients.

Both bills represent efforts by Members of Parliament to tackle specific challenges within the healthcare system. While Julie Cooper's bill focuses on providing support for carers, Nick Thomas Symonds' bill aims to address the affordability of medications."

"There were ""no merits"" in the argument requesting an appeal, it ruled.
In April, the court said a 2009 decision to drop the 783 charges against Mr Zuma was irrational.
He has always denied taking bribes over the arms deal.
National director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams had asked the court for permission to appeal against the earlier ruling, saying prosecutors should be able to exercise discretion over whether an investigation should continue.
Rejecting the request, High Court Judge Aubrey Ledwaba said: ""We seriously considered whether the appeal would have reasonable prospects  of success and came to the conclusion that there are no merits in the  arguments.""
The ruling is a blow to Mr Zuma's efforts to avoid standing trial, reports the BBC's Milton Nkosi from Johannesburg.
The president can still take the case to the Supreme Court of Appeal but it is difficult to see it overturning the unanimous ruling of the High Court, our correspondent says.
Mr Zuma's final option would be to ask the Constitutional Court to throw out the case.
Controversial arms deal: What you need to know
The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) has waged a seven-year battle to get Mr Zuma to stand trial over the charges.
In a separate case in March, the Constitutional Court said Mr Zuma breached his oath of office by failing to repay government money used to upgrade his private residence with a swimming pool, amphitheatre, chicken run and cattle enclosure.
It backed an earlier ruling by an anti-corruption body that said $23m (Â£15m) of public money had been improperly spent on Mr Zuma's rural home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province.","There were ""no merits"" in the argument requesting an appeal, it ruled.

"The International Kabaddi Federation said ""this is not the right time to engage with Pakistan"". The two-week-long event begins on Friday.
The neighbours last month accused each other of increasing hostilities along their de-facto border in Kashmir.
Kabaddi is a full-contact team sport which originated in India.
The championship in India's western city of Ahmedabad will feature top sides from Iran, Australia, South Korea, England, Poland, Kenya, Argentina and newcomers, the US.
The IKF chief, Deoraj Chaturvedi, told AFP news agency that Pakistan had been barred from the tournament due to an increase in tensions between the neighbours.
""Pakistan is a valuable member of the IKF but looking at the current scenario and in the best interest of both the nations, we decided that Pakistan must be refrained [from the championship,"" he said.
Pakistan's kabaddi officials said the tournament without Pakistan would be ""just like a football world cup without Brazil"".
""We have called a meeting to discuss this issue but let me tell you that a Kabaddi World Cup is no world cup without Pakistan,"" said the chief of the Pakistan Kabaddi Federation, Rana Muhammad Sarwar.

Relations between India and Pakistan have sharply deteriorated since last month, when militants carried out the deadliest attack on an Indian army base in Kashmir in years. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, which has denied the claim.
Last week, India said it had retaliated by carrying out ""surgical strikes"" against suspected militants along the de-facto border with Pakistan in Kashmir.
Pakistan denied that India had carried out any strikes and said two of its soldiers were killed in unprovoked cross-border shelling.","The International Kabaddi Federation said ""this is not the right time to engage with Pakistan"". The two-week-long event begins on Friday. The neighbours last month accused each other of increasing border tensions, and the recent decision of the International Kabaddi Federation reflects the strained relations between the two countries. Both countries have accused each other of escalating border tensions, and this has impacted their sporting engagements as well. The decision to not engage with Pakistan in the upcoming Kabaddi event could be seen as a diplomatic move by the International Kabaddi Federation to avoid further aggravating the already tense situation."
"Last week, Mr Macri ordered that files on Mr Nisman's death be made public.
A year on, it is still not clear whether Mr Nisman was murdered or killed himself.
The prosecutor was found dead hours before he was due to testify in Congress against former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
President Macri was speaking to Mr Nisman's teenage daughters on the eve of the first anniversary of their father's death.
Mr Nisman's eldest daughter, Iara, had written in a newspaper article that she believed that ""the death of my father was designed to create fear in people.""
She said ""I hope that we can find the truth about my father.""
Mr Nisman had been investigating Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack, the 1994 bombing of the Amia Jewish centre, for 10 years before he was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment.
Eighty-five people were killed as the building collapsed.
Much of the evidence was subsequently lost or contaminated, either deliberately or through incompetence, and no-one has ever been convicted in connection with the bombing.
The state prosecutor had been preparing to deliver a 350-page report to Congress in which he suggested Ms Fernandez may have covered up the alleged involvement of senior Iranian officials in the bombing.
Ms Fernandez has always rejected the allegations, claiming Mr Nisman was fed misleading information by a rogue intelligence agent trying to discredit her government.
The case has gripped Argentina - not only the investigation itself, but the country's investigative judicial service and forensic services have been under public scrutiny.
In February 2015, hundreds of thousands of people took part in a march in the capital Buenos Aires to mark one month since Mr Nisman's death.","Last week, Mr Macri ordered that files on Mr Nisman's death be made public. A year on, it is still not clear whether Mr Nisman was murdered or killed himself. The death of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman has remained a contentious issue, with ongoing debates about whether he was murdered or died by suicide. President Mauricio Macri recently ordered the declassification of files related to Nisman's death in an attempt to shed light on the case.

Alberto Nisman was found dead in his apartment on January 18, 2015, just days after accusing then-president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran's involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. Nisman's allegations were related to a memorandum of understanding signed between Argentina and Iran to jointly investigate the bombing.

Initially, the authorities declared Nisman's death as a suicide, but questions surrounding the circumstances of his demise persisted. Many believed that Nisman was killed to silence him and stop him from revealing information that could be damaging to influential individuals. Critics accused the government of a cover-up and alleged that vital evidence had been tampered with.

Over the years, various investigations have taken place, but definitive conclusions have not been reached. Missteps, irregularities, and controversial statements from officials have compounded the mystery and fueled skepticism. The case has become highly politicized, reflecting deep divisions within Argentine society.

President Macri's decision to make the files on Mr. Nisman's death public signifies a significant step towards transparency. However, it remains to be seen whether the information contained within those files will provide conclusive evidence or further complicate the understanding of Nisman's fate."
"It wants access to NHS records to help identify those eligible to pay the new Scottish rate of income tax (SRIT).
Labour has called on the Scottish and UK governments to ""get a serious grip"" of the situation. HMRC said the project was ""on track for successful delivery"".
From April 2016, Holyrood will set income tax rates for the first time.
Only those who spend most of the tax year resident in Scotland will be required to pay the Scottish rate.
HMRC is working to identify these Scottish taxpayers.
In a letter to the Commons public accounts committee, it said: ""This has proved more complex than was initially anticipated, which is why the rating for the risk relating to this area of work has increased.""
The letter, dated 16 January, was written by HMRC's tax assurance commissioner Edward Troup.
Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran said: ""This letter confirms what Scottish Labour has been saying all along - that HMRC and the Scottish government are struggling to identify all Scottish taxpayers.
""Both our governments need to get a serious grip of this.""
The Scottish government said administering the tax was a matter for the UK government and HMRC.
HMRC said it remained ""confident"" that it would ""be able to deliver SRIT and correctly tax Scottish taxpayers from April 2016"".
It has also revised the estimated cost of setting up the new tax downwards from £40-45m to £35-40m.
The agency is worried some people will try to dodge tax, when rates differ between Scotland and the rest of the UK, by falsifying their main residence.
HMRC is seeking access to NHS data to cross-reference information about where people live.
The Scottish government is consulting on this issue until 25 February.
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""A consultation is ongoing as to whether HMRC should be allowed administrative data to assist their identification of where people should pay tax.
""No decision has been taken.""
In his letter, Mr Troup said: ""We need to be sure that we have thoroughly explored all the available options for improving the accuracy of information we hold.""
HMRC has also floated the idea of using the electoral register.
In a statement to the BBC, the agency said: ""The Scottish electoral register could provide a potential list of people who live in Scotland but do not have a Scottish address on our system.""
Voter registration is particularly high at the moment following the independence referendum.
But when local authorities suggested using this data to help chase poll tax arrears, the Scottish government strongly objected.","It wants access to NHS records to help identify those eligible to pay the new Scottish rate of income tax (SRIT). Labour has called on the Scottish and UK governments to reject the plan, citing concerns over data privacy and potential misuse of personal information. The Scottish National Party (SNP) argues that obtaining access to NHS records would ensure accurate identification of tax-payers and prevent any potential tax avoidance.

The SRIT, introduced in 2016, allows the Scottish Government to set its own income tax rates and bands. This has led to the need for a reliable system to identify those liable for the new tax rates. The SNP government believes that accessing NHS records would provide an efficient and accurate method to identify taxpayers, ensuring a fair and transparent tax system.

However, Labour argues that allowing access to sensitive NHS records poses a risk to individuals' privacy and could potentially be misused. They propose alternative solutions such as the use of national insurance data to identify taxpayers. Labour believes that additional safeguards and guarantees need to be put in place to protect personal data before considering such access.

The debate has yet to be resolved, and it remains to be seen whether the Scottish and UK governments will adopt the SNP's proposal or find alternative methods to identify those eligible to pay the SRIT."
"The England midfielder, 24, made his debut from the bench in Saturday's 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion.
Wilshere played only three games for the Gunners last season after fracturing his leg - the latest setback in a career plagued by injuries.
""If there is any question mark about me, I know it's about my fitness,"" he told BBC Match of the Day.
""Hopefully I can play as many games as possible, prove everyone wrong and then [reignite] my career.""
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Wilshere does not need to prove his quality as a player, as he considers him ""world class"" and wants the midfielder to spend his entire career with the Gunners.
Wilshere, who has started just 80 Premier League games for Arsenal in eight years, made two substitute appearances for the Gunners this season before joining Bournemouth.
Wilshere has 34 international caps and featured six times for England during the summer - including three games at Euro 2016 - but played no part in the 1-0 win over Slovakia in their World Cup qualifier earlier this month after being overlooked for new manager Sam Allardyce's first squad.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe says Wilshere's workload is being managed and insists he has signed a player who remains ""the very best in his position"".
Wilshere added: ""I was happy to come on and was sitting on the bench watching and getting used to the way they play.
""It's similar to the way we played at Arsenal. They like to keep the ball and I can fit into this team, I think.""","The England midfielder, 24, made his debut from the bench in Saturday's 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion. Wilshere played only three games for the Gunners last season after injury kept him sidelined for the majority of the campaign. However, he has now fully recovered and is eager to prove himself once again.

Wilshere's return to action has been eagerly anticipated by Arsenal fans, who have long admired his technical ability and tenacity on the pitch. The midfielder burst onto the scene as a teenager and quickly established himself as one of the most promising young players in English football.

However, a series of injuries hampered his progress and limited his playing time. Many wondered if Wilshere would ever be able to fulfill his potential and regain his place in the Arsenal starting lineup.

But now, after a long and arduous road to recovery, Wilshere is ready to prove his doubters wrong. He showcased glimpses of his talent in Saturday's match, displaying his trademark close control and passing range.

The midfielder's performance against West Bromwich Albion was encouraging, and it's clear that he still possesses the skill and determination that made him such a highly regarded prospect.

Wilshere's return to form could not have come at a better time for Arsenal, as they look to mount a serious title challenge this season. His ability to dictate play from midfield and create chances for his teammates will be crucial in their pursuit of success.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has been impressed by Wilshere's attitude and work ethic during his recovery and is confident that he can play an important role"
"Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said ministers needed to consider whether continuing served the public interest.
Labour's Tom Watson said it was ""a sad day"" for victims of press intrusion.
A second phase would look at the extent of unlawful conduct in media groups and the police and how allegations were investigated.
Ms Bradley told MPs she wanted to seek the views of the public, interested parties and the victims of press abuse before making a final decision.
""Given the extent of these criminal investigations, the implementation of the recommendations from part one of the Leveson Inquiry and the cost to the taxpayer of the investigations in part one, which is Â£43.7 million and Â£5.4 million respectively, the government is considering whether undertaking part two is still in the public interest,"" she said.
""We are keen to take stock and seek the views of the public and interested parties, not least those who have been victims of press abuse.""
Shadow culture secretary Mr Watson accused the government of letting down the victims who had been ""thrown to the wolves"".
""Leveson part 2 is the investigation into how the cover-up of phone hacking was conducted,"" he said.
""In effect she [Ms Bradley] is today announcing a consultation on whether the cover-up should be covered up.""
Former Labour minister Chris Bryant, himself a victim of phone-hacking, accused ministers of ""reneging on all those promises made to the victims"" that Leveson 2 would take place.
The consultation will run for 10 weeks, and finish on 10 January.
It will also invite views on whether to implement legislation that could require newspapers to pay libel costs - even if they won their case.
They would be liable if they had not first offered a cheaper alternative like public arbitration and if they had chosen not to join an industry regulator approved under royal charter.
Newspapers signed up to the regulator would be exempt from the laws.
Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 - one of the key commitments made after the first part of the Leveson Inquiry - still needs to be signed off by the culture secretary three years on.
Dr Evan Harris, of the Hacked Off campaign, which represents many victims of phone-hacking and press intrusion, said: ""It is almost unthinkable that a prime minister who claims to be willing to stand up to police and corporate interests would even consider postponing - let alone cancelling - an inquiry into cover-ups and corruption in our major national institutions.""
Part two had been expected to get under way once all legal proceedings - including criminal investigations - had been completed.
In May 2012, Lord Justice Leveson said that before proceeding to part two, consideration should be given ""by everyone"" to ""the value to be gained"" from it, given the ""enormous cost"" involved, the fact that material would be years out of date, and it could take longer than the first part of the inquiry.","Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said ministers needed to consider whether continuing served the public interest. Labour's Tom Watson said it was ""a sad day"" for victims of press intrusion. A spokesperson for victims of press intrusion group Hacked Off said it was ""a betrayal of promises made to the victims of press abuse"". The comments came after it was revealed that the government was considering scrapping plans to enforce the second part of the Leveson inquiry into press standards and media ethics. The first part of the inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, was completed in 2012 and made several recommendations for reforming the press. The second part was meant to investigate the extent of unlawful conduct by the press and the police, as well as the relationship between the press and politicians. However, the government has stated that there have been significant changes in the media landscape since the first part of the inquiry and that continuing with the second part may no longer be necessary. Proponents of the second part argue that it is essential for holding the press accountable and preventing further instances of press abuse."
"In an emergency statement at Holyrood, he apologised to rail passengers who have been affected by disruption.
It came on the day commuters faced severe disruption after overhead wiring problems affected services in Glasgow.
ScotRail declared a major incident after finding a broken insulator between Partick and Glasgow Central.
The rail operator said the issue caused disruption and cancellations between Glasgow Central and Dalmuir, Milngavie and Maryhill.
There has been widespread criticism of the reliability of ScotRail trains since Abellio took over the franchise.
Abellio has said the terms of the contract meant government ministers were responsible for overcrowding on the network.
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Yousaf admitted that ScotRail's performance was not ""up to scratch"" but he said it was higher than the UK average.
He also outlined a series of actions and investments Scotrail will make.
They include an earlier commuter service between Inverness and the central belt, which will begin in mid-December, and the addition of carriages to peak services on the Borders Railway in a bid to reduce overcrowding.
The minister said: ""Everyone rightly expects a railway network that operates effectively. So when things go wrong I fully understand the dissatisfaction of passengers and the inconvenience that is caused.
""Although there are no guarantees major failures won't happen, I give my reassurance that ScotRail has learned lessons and is far better prepared for contingencies, including communication with passengers, when such incidents do take place.""
He added: ""I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered. I am taking action and a plan is now in place. This government has a track record of delivering for our railways and it is my firm intention that we will continue to do so.""
In his statement, Mr Yousaf also highlighted:
ScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below the expected standard.
At Holyrood, the minister faced calls to publish the plan in full from Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.
Mr Yousaf agreed to speak to ScotRail about its publication in the interests of ""accountability and transparency"".
Scottish Labour's transport spokesman Neil Bibby said the rail service has become worse since the improvement plan was demanded.
He added: ""His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions.
""Humza Yousaf claims he's not a transport expert - and he's right. Humza Yousaf must ditch the spin and publish his 246 point improvement plan in full.""
Murdo Fraser, of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was time the government started taking responsibility for the railways' poor performance.
The latest performance data showed 86% of ScotRail trains were on time or less than five minutes late between 16 October and 12 November, with wide variations in reliability across the country.
ScotRail's figures remained better than the average for all UK train operators - with the company also enjoying better than average customer satisfaction figures when the latest data was published earlier this year.
But Abellio's contract to run the ScotRail franchise requires the company to ensure 91.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of schedule.
The Scottish government can cancel the contract if performance drops to 84.3% for three months in a row.","In an emergency statement at Holyrood, he apologised to rail passengers who have been affected by disruption. It came on the day commuters faced severe disruption after overhead wiring problems caused major delays and cancellations. The emergency statement was made in response to growing anger and frustration from the public over the ongoing issues with Scotland's rail services.

During the statement, the official expressed deep regret for the inconvenience caused to passengers and acknowledged that the disruption had severely impacted their daily routines and travel plans. He acknowledged the emotional and financial toll it has taken on commuters and assured them that the government is fully committed to resolving the situation quickly and effectively.

The official announced that an independent review of Scotland's railway infrastructure would be conducted to identify the underlying issues and propose necessary improvements. Additionally, he promised increased investment in maintenance and upgrades to address the ongoing problems that have plagued the rail network.

Furthermore, the official extended his gratitude to the rail employees who have been working tirelessly to minimize the disruption and ensure the safety of passengers. He also encouraged passengers affected by the disruption to seek compensation through available channels and assured them that they would be supported in their claims.

The emergency statement aimed to convey a sincere apology to the affected passengers while also highlighting the government's commitment to rectifying the underlying issues and improving Scotland's rail services."

"The executions took place in Besi prison on the island of Nusakambangan early on Wednesday morning local time.
However, the execution of a ninth convict, a woman from the Philippines, was postponed at the last minute.
Among those killed were Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Australia has withdrawn its ambassador in response.
The Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, called the pair's executions ""cruel and unnecessary"".
He said Australia respected Indonesia's sovereignty but added, ""this cannot be simply business as usual"".
Those put to death also include Nigerian nationals, a Brazilian and an Indonesian.
Filipina woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso was also due to be executed, but this was delayed after a request by the Philippine president, a spokesman from the attorney general's office told the BBC.
The request came after someone suspected of framing Veloso to carry heroin into Indonesia surrendered to police in the Philippines, the spokesman went on.
Indonesia would give Veloso the chance to testify as a witness in the trial in the Philippines, the spokesman said.
Her mother described the last minute reprieve as a ""miracle"".
""We are so happy, I can't believe it. I can't believe my child will live,"" Celia Veloso told Philippine radio station DZMM.
A Frenchman also convicted of drug offences, Serge Areski Atlaoui, has also been sentenced to death but has an appeal outstanding.
Amnesty International described the executions as ""utterly reprehensible"".
""The execution of eight people in Indonesia today shows complete disregard for due process and human rights safeguards,"" it said in a statement.
Earlier, the eight prisoners were allowed to spend their final moments with their families.
Relatives of Chan and Sukumaran were visibly distressed and Sukumaran's sister collapsed and had to be carried to the prison.
Australia had urged Indonesia to delay the execution of its two nationals until a corruption investigation into their case was complete.
Chan and Sukumaran, along with seven other Australians, were arrested in Bali in 2005 for trying to smuggle more than 18lb (8.2kg) of heroin from Indonesia to Australia.
The pair were later found to be the ringleaders of the group and sentenced to death. The other seven members of the ""Bali Nine"" are currently serving either life or 20 years in prison.
Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world and ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013.
It says it takes a hard line because of the country's own drugs problem - 33 Indonesians die every day as a result of drugs, according to Indonesia's National Narcotics Agency.","The executions took place in Besi prison on the island of Nusakambangan early on Wednesday morning local time. However, the execution of a ninth convict, a woman from the Philippines, was unexpectedly delayed due to legal issues surrounding her case. The Indonesian authorities have not provided specific details on the reasons for the postponement, but it is believed to be related to the ongoing legal appeals and diplomatic discussions between the Philippines and Indonesia.

The Filipino woman, whose identity has not been disclosed to the public, was convicted for her involvement in drug trafficking and sentenced to death by firing squad along with the other eight convicts. Her case has gained significant attention and prompted appeals from the Philippine government and international human rights organizations, calling for her sentence to be commuted.

The postponement of her execution has brought temporary relief to her family and supporters, who continue to tirelessly advocate for her clemency. The Philippine government has been working diplomatically to secure a stay of execution and explore alternative options for her case.

The Indonesian government has a strict stance against drug-related offenses and views capital punishment as an effective deterrent. However, the implementation of the death penalty has faced criticism both domestically and internationally, highlighting concerns about due process, human rights, and the potential for wrongful convictions.

As the legal and diplomatic processes continue, the fate of the Filipino woman hangs in the balance. Her case serves as a reminder of the complexities and controversies surrounding capital punishment and the ongoing global debates on its legitimacy and fairness."

The WBO world middleweight title holder admitted failing to display a guard dog warning sign and said he was ""very very sorry"".
He was fined £205 by Stevenage Magistrates' Court.
Prosecutor Roseanne Smith said Chalkley, 24, had tied the dog up while he went into the shop on 13 September.
Shortly after he returned, William Thorlin walked by and the dog lunged, ""clamping his left forearm above the wrist.""
His injuries required a skin graft from his thigh to his left arm and stitches to his left hand.
Chalkley admitted having a dangerous dog out of control.
Officers subsequently charged Saunders with the offence of not displaying a guard dog warning sign after tracing Chalkley back to the stables.
The boxer said the sign ""was in a truck"" but he ""had not put it up"" and that had since been corrected.
He told the court he had not given his friend permission to take the dog away from the site.
Saunders added he ""was let down by a friend. I am very very sorry for what happened and want to pay £500 compensation to the victim.""","Magistrates heard the German shepherd attacked the 73-year-old outside a shop in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.

The court heard that Chalkley had a personal grudge against the elderly man, identified as Mr. Saunders, and hatched a plan to use the dog as a weapon to harm him.

"The 28-year-old will serve an immediate three-game ban, while seven matches are suspended until the end of the season.
The player must also pay a fine of £7,500.

The SFA has a blanket ban on footballers betting on any matches.
Rangers Football Club notes today's verdict by the Judicial Panel  which has imposed a 10-match ban and £7,500 fine
The penalty applies to charges of  ""betting on three football matches on then-registered club not to win"" and ""betting on a further 10 football matches that involved then-registered club"".
A third charge of ""betting on a further 147 football matches"" resulted in a censure.
It is the first time a player in Scotland has been punished for breaking gambling regulations.
Black played for Inverness CT, Hearts and Rangers in the period concerned.
The midfielder, capped once for Scotland, will miss games against Arbroath, Queen of the South and Forfar and will be free to return for the League One meeting with Stenhousemuir on 28 September.
The suspended penalty will only be triggered if the player commits a further breach of disciplinary rules 22 or 23, which apply to betting.
Fraser Wishart, chief executive of the players' union PFA Scotland, said he did not have an opinion on the punishment handed to Black, but insisted it presented an opportunity for all stakeholders in the Scottish game to review and bolster the rules regarding players gambling on football matches.
""If there is any good outcome from this, then I think it's raised the spectre of this regulation,"" said Wishart.

The Football Association (FA) determined that Black's actions merited a three-game ban, meaning he will not be able to participate in his team's next three matches. Additionally, Black will face a further seven-match suspension that will be imposed if he commits a similar offense before the end of the season. This means that any misconduct from Black during the remaining matches could result in him being banned for an extended period.

"US customs officials say Jose Aguilar was arrested by federal agents who found four illegal migrants from China in the boot of his car.

""Jose Aguilar is a young man who will address this matter in court, not with the press,"" he said.
The arrest took place two weeks ago - but details, including Jose Aguilar's involvement, emerged on Friday.
US Customs and Border Protection said Mr Aguilar was arrested at the border in San Diego after a sniffer dog alerted federal agents to the stowaways in the boot of his car.
The migrants reportedly said they had agreed to pay Mr Aguilar between $3,000 and $60,000 (Â£2,390 and Â£47,830) to be smuggled into the US.

Smith further claimed that Aguilar had no involvement in smuggling and was unaware of the migrants' origins or their immigration status.

Smith stated that Aguilar's prior clean record and lack of any previous smuggling accusations support his client's innocence. He emphasized that Aguilar was cooperative with the authorities during the arrest and provided all necessary documents and information requested.

The lawyer also highlighted the possibility of his client being a victim of a set-up or coercion, aiming to exploit his client's naivety or lack of awareness regarding the situation.

"The Newcastle United owner is being sued by Jeffrey Blue at London's High Court.
Mr Blue said he was promised £15m if he managed to increase Sports Direct's share price to £8, but that he only received £1m.
But Mr Ashley said their meetings were drink-fuelled ""banter"".
Mr Blue says Mr Ashley, who runs Sports Direct, did not stick to a commercial agreement.
But in a written statement, the sportswear tycoon said: ""I can't believe that [Mr Blue] is now trying to take me for £14m off the back of some drink banter that he is seeking to engineer into something more.""
Mr Justice Leggatt has heard that the dispute between Mr Blue and Mr Ashley relates to a conversation in a London pub called the Horse & Groom in 2013.
Mr Blue came under attack from Mr Ashley's lawyers as he gave evidence during the second day of the hearing.
Mike Ashley 'vomited into fireplace at pub meeting'
David Cavender QC, who leads Mr Ashley's legal team, accused Mr Blue of ""making up evidence"" and said the claim was an ""opportunistic try-on"".
Mr Cavender also said Mr Ashley ""fairly"" said he could not recall details of conversations in the Horse & Groom, ""particularly in the light of the amount of drinking"".
""He does recall 'that there was a lot of banter and bravado'.
""He does not recall any discussion about whether Mr Blue would be paid a sum of money if the share price reached £8 a share.""
Mr Ashley is due to give evidence on Wednesday.
The hearing continues.","The Newcastle United owner is being sued by Jeffrey Blue at London's High Court. Mr Blue said he was promised £15m if he managed to increase Sports Direct's share price by 8% from £4 to £4.32. However, he claimed that owner Mike Ashley only paid him £1m instead, leaving him £14m short.

Jeffrey Blue, a former investment banker, described a meeting between him and Mike Ashley at a London pub in January 2013. He alleged that during this meeting, Ashley made the promise of a £15m bonus if Sports Direct's share price reached the specified target.

According to Blue, he successfully achieved the target by April 2014, but when he approached Ashley for the promised bonus, the owner refused to pay the full amount. Instead, Ashley allegedly told Blue: ""I'll pay you £1m if you like, but not a penny more.""

In response, Jeffrey Blue filed a case against Mike Ashley, claiming that the promise made to him amounted to a verbal contract. Blue argued that he took on considerable risk by investing in Sports Direct shares and working towards increasing their value, expecting the agreed upon bonus in return.

Mike Ashley, who owns Newcastle United Football Club as well as the majority of Sports Direct, denied making the verbal agreement. His defense team argued that the conversation at the pub was merely a drinking session between friends, and any talk of a £15m bonus was nothing more than boastful banter.

The case went to London's High Court in July 2017, and the trial lasted for two weeks. During the trial, both Jeffrey Blue and Mike Ashley gave"

To see who else is being #HonestAboutExercise find us on Facebook and Twitter. Inspire others. Share your story too.","Media playback is not supported on this device Social media and the press are bursting with ""inspirational"" images and stories of fitness for us to aspire to. But do these images and stories actually have a positive impact on our fitness goals? The answer to this question is not straightforward.

On one hand, the constant stream of fitness-related content on social media can be motivating and inspiring for some individuals. Seeing others achieve their fitness goals can serve as a reminder that it is possible for us too. It can provide a sense of community and support, as users often share workout routines, healthy recipes, and success stories. Additionally, social media platforms often provide access to a wide range of fitness resources, such as workout tutorials and nutritional advice, which can be beneficial for those seeking guidance.

On the other hand, the constant exposure to seemingly perfect bodies and fitness achievements can have negative consequences. Social media often promotes unrealistic beauty standards and can create feelings of inadequacy if individuals compare themselves unfavorably to the images they see. These idealized portrayals of fitness can lead to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy behaviors, such as excessive dieting or over-exercising, in an attempt to attain these unrealistic ideals.

Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of the information shared on social media are sometimes questionable. Influencers and individuals may promote certain products or diets without scientific evidence or proper qualifications. This can mislead individuals and potentially harm their health if they follow unsafe or unsupported advice.

It is also important to consider the impact of social media on mental health. Constant exposure to edited and curated images can contribute to feelings of self-doubt, self-consciousness, and low self-esteem. This can have a significant negative impact on overall well-being and mental health, which can indirectly affect physical fitness.

In summary, while social media and the press can provide inspiration and tools for achieving fitness goals, it is crucial to approach these platforms critically and with awareness. Understanding the potential for comparison, unrealistic expectations, and misinformation can help individuals navigate the online fitness landscape in a healthier and more balanced way. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize individual well-being and listen to one's body rather than solely relying on external influences."
"The League One club were granted permission to build an initial 11,000-seater ground by Merton Borough Council in December 2015.
However, the plans were called in for review in March by Boris Johnson, who was then London's Mayor.
Khan has called for any information which challenges Merton's decision.
AFC Wimbledon, who currently play in Kingston, see a move to Merton and Plough Lane as a return to their spiritual home, as it is where the original Wimbledon FC played until 1991.
The Dons' plans to redevelop the current site of Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium could see the capacity of the proposed new stadium increased to 20,000, and include the construction of 602 residential units.
In a report published by the Greater London Authority, Khan indicated his preference to reverse Johnson's decision to review the application, and hand the decision back to Merton council.
Dons chief executive Erik Samuelson and councillor Stephen Alambritis, the leader of Merton Council, have welcomed Khan's move but Wandsworth Council have previously objected to the scheme.
A decision from Khan, who was elected London Mayor in May, is expected once all the responses to the consultation have been considered.
The original Wimbledon FC were forced to leave Plough Lane in 1991 following the publication of the Taylor Report, which, in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, recommended that top-flight sides should play in all-seater stadiums.
They shared Selhurst Park with Crystal Palace until 2003 when they moved to Milton Keynes, having been given permission to relocate by an independent commission a year earlier.
The club were subsequently renamed MK Dons, while their old Plough Lane home became a residential development.
AFC Wimbledon, formed in 2002 in response to the relocation, have played all their home games at Kingsmeadow, which is also home to non-league Kingstonian.
They have won six promotions in the 14 years since their formation, reaching the third tier with a 2-0 victory over Plymouth Argyle in the League Two play-off in May.
AFC Wimbledon took over the leasehold of Kingsmeadow in March 2003 and have agreed to sell the ground to Premier League side Chelsea.","The League One club were granted permission to build an initial 11,000-seater ground by Merton Borough Council in December 2015. However, the plans were called in for review in March 2016 by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. In his review, Khan asked for further assessments to be conducted regarding the impact of the proposed stadium on the local community and transportation infrastructure.

Following the review, the Mayor of London approved the plans for the new stadium in June 2016, but imposed certain conditions on the club. These conditions included measures to mitigate the impact on local traffic and ensuring adequate transport links to the stadium.

In response to the approval, the League One club started construction on the 11,000-seater ground in July 2016. The project faced some delays due to unforeseen challenges during the construction process, but eventually, the stadium was completed in September 2018.

The new ground provided a significant upgrade for the club, allowing them to accommodate more fans, enhance the matchday experience, and generate additional revenue. The stadium also featured modern facilities and amenities, including improved seating, hospitality areas, and better accessibility.

Overall, the approval and construction of the new 11,000-seater ground marked an important milestone for the League One club, providing them with a state-of-the-art facility to better serve their fans and community."
"The warning came amid contradictory claims of an Israeli strike in Syria.
Syria says Israeli war planes bombed a military research centre north-west of Damascus, but the US and others say lorries carrying weapons bound for Lebanon were hit.
Israel has maintained silence about the incident, but Syria has made a formal complaint to the UN.
Damascus says it reserves the right to defend itself, while its allies Russia and Iran have strongly denounced the attack.
Q&A: Israeli 'strike' on Syria
Analysis: Strike adds complexity to tense region
The Syrian army statement about the incident, carried on state media, said Israeli fighter jets had carried out a direct strike on a scientific research centre in Jamraya, killing two people and wounding five.
But a US official told the BBC the target was a convoy carrying SA-17 surface-to-air missiles. Some rebel groups have said they targeted the Jamraya centre.
Israel has declined to comment.
The latest developments have struck a country in turmoil. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad continues to cling to power despite a 22-month conflict that has killed more than 60,000 people.
White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes did not confirm details of Israel's raid itself, but had a warning to issue to Syria.
""Syria should not further destabilise the region by transferring weaponry to Hezbollah,"" he said.
By Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut
Amid a welter of contradictory reports and rumours, it seems to be established that Israel did mount a lightning air strike inside Syria, despite complete silence from Israeli officials.
That is their normal practice on such occasions. Additionally, they know that intervening in the complex Syrian internal conflict carries big political risks, not least being accused of teaming up with the rebels.
That is exactly what has happened, with Syria and its allies Iran and Hezbollah saying the attack exposed complicity between Israel, the West, and the Syrian opposition.
Israel knows that intervening in such a way would be likely to embarrass the rebels and strengthen President Assad politically. Whatever prompted it to act must have been compelling enough to override that consideration.
Israel has made it clear that arms transfers from Syria to Hezbollah would constitute a red line.
Most Western accounts believe such an arms convoy was the target. If the Jamraya complex was instead - or also - hit, as Damascus insists, the Israelis must have suspected that something seriously dangerous was going on there.
News of the attack does not appear to have generated much alarm in Washington, says the BBC's Paul Adams.
Indeed, he says, the presence in Washington of Israel's military intelligence chief suggests the Obama administration may have been told about the raid beforehand.
But Syria's foreign ministry summoned the UN commander in the Golan to deliver a formal protest, saying Israel's action violated the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two sides, who remain technically at war.
A UN observer force has been in place in the Golan since 1974, with the task of providing ""an area of separation and for two equal zones of limited forces and armaments on both sides of the area"".
""Syria holds Israel and those who are protecting it at the Security Council responsible for the results of the attack and confirms its right to defend its land and sovereignty,"" Syria said in a letter to the UN, reported by state media.
But Syria itself is hardly in a position to do much, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut.
Both Hezbollah and Iran are also under pressure at the moment, and Israel's calculation must be that none of those hostile parties has an interest in triggering a regional conflagration right now, our correspondent says.
Later, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed ""grave concern"" over reports of Israel's action, and called on all concerned to respect international law.
Syria's allies denounced Israel's action, while Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi condemned the alleged air strike as an ""overt assault based on the West's policy"" to undermine stability in Syria.
Russia - a stalwart defender of Syria on the international diplomatic scene despite its warming trade and economic ties with Israel - also took a strong stance.
""If this information is confirmed,"" said the foreign ministry, ""then we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets on the territory of a sovereign country, which blatantly violates the UN Charter and is unacceptable, no matter the motives to justify it.""
Earlier Syria's ambassador to Lebanon warned Damascus could take a ""surprise"" decision to retaliate.
""Israel is closer today to confrontation on the northern front more than it has been at any point since the Second Lebanon War."" Alex Fishman, Yedioth Ahronoth
""It could be seen as a hint to other countries, like Turkey and the US, that a military attack on Syria to topple the regime may be an option."" Zvi Barel, Ha'aretz
""There have been many signs in recent days that winds of war are blowing in the north. Butâ€¦ an attack, which did or did not take place, will not lead to an immediate round of combat in the north."" Amir Rapaport, Ma'ariv

US Vice-President Joe Biden is travelling to Germany, where he is expected to discuss the situation in Syria with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the Syrian opposition leader, Moaz al-Khatib.
The Syrian army statement said the Jamraya centre - which was focused on ""raising our level of resistance and self-defence"" - was damaged in the attack, and specifically denied reports that an arms convoy had been hit.
It said ""armed terrorist gangs"" - a term the government uses to describe rebel groups - had tried and failed repeatedly to capture the same facility in recent months.
But an opposition activist told the Washington Post that, although there had been two attacks on the centre early on Wednesday, ""we did not hear any airplanes... Unless the airplanes were silenced by some technology.""
""I mean, is it possible for an air fighter to attack at night, and we don't even hear its sound?""
Some reports suggest the facility could be Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, known by its French acronym CERS, believed to be the state organisation responsible for developing biological and chemical weapons.
Lebanese military and internal security forces say there has been increased activity by Israeli warplanes over Lebanon in the past week, and particularly on Tuesday and the early hours of Wednesday morning.
There is increasing concern in Israel that Syria's chemical weapons could fall into Hezbollah's hands.
Correspondents say Israel is also concerned the Shia militant group could obtain anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, thus strengthening its ability to respond to Israeli air strikes.
Israel believes Syria received a battery of SA-17s from Russia after an alleged Israeli air strike in 2007 that destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, analysts say.
Wednesday's reported attack came days after Israel moved its Iron Dome defence system to the north of the country.","The warning came amid contradictory claims of an Israeli strike in Syria. Syria says Israeli war planes bombed a military research centre north-west of Damascus, but the US and others have denied any involvement. The Israeli government has remained quiet on the matter. Syrian state media reported explosions in the area and said that air defenses intercepted most of the missiles. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said that at least six Iranian-backed fighters were killed in the attack.

The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, who are believed to be carrying out a shadow war in Syria. Iran has been accused of establishing military bases and supporting militant groups in the war-torn country, while Israel has repeatedly launched airstrikes against Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria.

The contradictory claims and lack of clarity have contributed to the uncertainty surrounding the situation. It is not uncommon for conflicting narratives to emerge during such incidents, making it challenging to ascertain the true facts."

"Mr Jammeh initially accepted defeat in the 1 December poll, but later said it was flawed.
The Ecowas chairman said Senegal had been chosen to lead operations ""to restore the people's wishes"" if needed.
President Jammeh has already said he will not be intimidated, saying Ecowas had no authority to interfere.
Mr Jammeh, who has ruled for 22 years, has lodged a case before the Supreme Court to annul the vote after the electoral commission changed some results.
The commission insists the outcome was not affected by an initial error and that property developer Adama Barrow won the poll and should be inaugurated on 19 January.
Marcel Alain de Souza, chairman of the Ecowas commission, said Mr Jammeh had until that date to comply with its mediators.
""If he is not going, we have stand-by forces already alerted and these stand-by forces have to be able to intervene to restore the people's wish,"" he said.
The Gambia, a former British colony, is surrounded on three sides by Senegal.
""Senegal has been selected by its peers to lead the operations but we do not wish to start a conflict,"" Mr de Souza said.
""If he loves his people, he has to be able to negotiate an exit door calmly. If it doesn't happen, the most radical means will be used.""
The BBC's Umaru Fofana, who has been reporting from The Gambia, says Mr Jammeh's defiant comments earlier this week make it clear that Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, appointed chief mediator by Ecowas, has a fine line to tread.
Mr Jammeh said that although he was a ""man of peace"", that did not mean he would not defend himself and the country ""courageously, patriotically and win"".
The stalemate is already taking a huge toll on the economy of the small West African country, which is popular with tourists, with the Chamber of Commerce saying businesses have been badly affected, our reporter says.
The Supreme Court says it will hear a case brought by Mr Jammeh's party to cancel the result on 10 January.
President Jammeh, 51, seized power in 1994 and has been accused of human rights abuses, although he has held regular elections.
The Gambia has not had a smooth transfer of power since independence from Britain in 1965.

"Najib Razak said this was the conclusion of fresh analysis of satellite data tracking the flight.
Malaysia Airlines had told the families of the 239 people on board, he said.
The BBC has seen a text message sent to families by the airline saying it had to be assumed ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the plane was lost and there were no survivors.
There were 227 passengers on flight MH370, many of them Chinese.
Relatives of those on board who watched the announcement at a Beijing hotel wept with grief, and some were taken away on stretchers by medical teams.
China has demanded that the Malaysian authorities make available the evidence on which they based their announcement about the jet's fate.
And some relatives of Chinese passengers expressed scepticism about their conclusion, as the plane has not been found yet.
Flight MH370 disappeared after taking off on 8 March from Kuala Lumpur.
A big international search operation has been taking place in the southern Indian Ocean, along the southern arc or corridor of the plane's possible route, more than 1,500 miles (2,500km) off the south-west coast of Australia.
However, the search had to be suspended on Tuesday due to bad weather, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said.
By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing
The news that the Malaysian authorities had now given up hope of finding anyone alive was met by the families with a mixture of deep anguish and some anger, at the hotel where many are staying.
As they emerged in front of the world's media some people collapsed.
One woman, falling on the floor, said that her only son, her daughter-in-law and only grandson were on the flight, and that her family had been destroyed.
A number were taken from the room on stretchers.
It is more than likely that the families' mistrust and suspicion about the message they have been given will linger. Many of the relatives here will want to see pieces of wreckage.
One woman said after the briefing: ""If my daughter is alive, I want to meet her. If my daughter is dead, I want to see her body.""
In the past day, both Australian and Chinese air force crews have reported spotting debris.
The unidentified objects have been seen in separate parts of the vast search area, in some of the world's most treacherous and remote waters.
The announcement by Prime Minister Najib Razak came at a late-night news conference in Kuala Lumpur.
It was based on new analysis by British satellite firm Inmarsat, which provided satellite data, and the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).
The firms ""have concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth,"" Mr Najib said.
""This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.""
Mr Najib appealed to the media to respect the privacy of the families of the passengers and crew, saying the wait for information had been heartbreaking and this latest news harder still.
Malaysia Airlines later said it informed the majority of the families in advance of the prime minister's statement in person and by telephone, and that text messages ""were used only as an additional means of communicating with the families"".
Text of PM's statement
The text messages read: ""Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived... we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean.""
Selamat Omar, the father of a 29-year-old aviation engineer who was on the flight, said some family members of other passengers broke down in tears at the news.
""We accept the news of the tragedy. It is fate,"" Selamat told the Associated Press in Kuala Lumpur.
Inmarsat had already revealed that it did indeed receive signals - automated ""pings"" - from the plane over its satellite network after the aircraft ceased radio and radar contact.
Sources told the BBC that flight MH370 continued to ping for at least five hours after the aircraft left Malaysian airspace - which indicated the plane was intact and powered.
And initial analysis showed the location of the final ""ping"" was probably along one of two vast arcs running north and south.
On Monday, the Malaysian prime minister said Inmarsat had been able to shed further light on the plane's flight path by performing further calculations on the MH370 data ""using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort"".
According to Inmarsat, this involved a totally new way of modelling, which was why it took time.
The company told the BBC the new calculation involved crunching far more data and that engineers spent all weekend looking back at previous Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flights.
They compared the satellite data from those flights with flight MH370 and were able to work out that it went south.
As far as the engineers could tell, the plane was flying at a cruising height above 30,000ft, but its final position could not be pinpointed more clearly, says BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott.
Inmarsat gave the AAIB the new data on Sunday, it said, which had to be checked before it could be made public.","Najib Razak said this was the conclusion of fresh analysis of satellite data tracking the flight. Malaysia Airlines had told the families of the 239 people on board, he said. The statement made by Najib Razak was regarding the conclusion drawn from a new analysis of satellite data that was used to track the flight of Malaysia Airlines. He mentioned that this information was relayed to the families of the 239 individuals who were on board the flight."
"Eleven were jailed at Bradford Crown Court after being convicted of raping the girl in Keighley from the age of 13.
Another man was sentenced for sexual activity with the same girl.
The trial heard how the teenager was repeatedly attacked over a period of 13 months, between 2011 and 2012.
More on this story and others from West Yorkshire
She was made to have sex in various locations in the town, including an underground car park and a church graveyard.
The girl was described in court as leading a ""chaotic existence"" at the time and had been reported missing from home on more than 70 occasions over a two-year period.
Two of the men also received sentences for offences against other victims.
Judge Roger Thomas QC, sentencing, told the men: ""She was only 13 or 14 when the 12 of you took such terrible and heartless sexual advantage of her.""
The jury previously heard her meetings with the men had been arranged by ""drug dealer"" Arif Choudhury, who was not on trial.
Tauqeer Hussain was also found guilty of raping a second girl in 2009.
The court heard Mahmood, who pleaded guilty to several charges at an earlier hearing, is currently serving an eight-year jail sentence for raping a woman in a park in Keighley and trying to abduct a 10-year-old girl.
Kabir, who received the greatest jail term of 20 years, was also sentenced for 12 sexual offences against two other young girls after being found guilty at a separate trial.
Kris Hopkins, Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, said: ""Keighley's proud name has been dragged through the mud too many times in recent years because of the heinous acts of sick men preying on vulnerable young girls.
""I appeal directly to members of the local community that if you know of any individual or groups of individuals who may be involved in these activities, you have an obligation to pass this information on.
""We must work together to rid ourselves of this cancer and we all have a part to play.""","Eleven were jailed at Bradford Crown Court after being convicted of raping the girl in Keighley from the age of 13. Another man was sentenced for sexual activity with the girl. The crimes occurred between 2011 and 2012, and 2014 and 2015. The victim was coerced and manipulated by the group of men, who groomed her with drugs and alcohol before subjecting her to repeated sexual abuse. The court heard that the girl was targeted due to her vulnerability and exploited over a prolonged period. The perpetrators were sentenced to a combined total of more than 100 years in prison. The judge commented that the case was particularly disturbing and that the defendants had shown no remorse for their actions. The victim, who is now an adult, bravely spoke out about her ordeal, hoping that her story would encourage other victims to come forward."
"However, the sinking of the fishing vessel and drowning of more than 300 African migrants appeared to generate little comment in the media of their home continent.
The Awate.com news website, which is hosted in the United States and serves an Eritrean audience, did comment on the incident, saying that ''the only way to stop such tragedies from repeating over and over again is to target the root cause - the predatory Eritrean regime'', which it said Eritrean migrants were escaping from. ã€€
In Italy, the main papers all carried pictures of body bags, survivors and rescuers.
""Lampedusa, a sea of dead"" was the headline of local daily La Sicilia. ""Immigrant apocalypse"" read the front page of the Giornale di SicliaSicilia The front page of Rome's Il Tempo featured a white cross against a black background with the headline ""Welcome to Italy"".
National daily Corriere Della Sera carried a front-page commentary by Gian Antonio Stella saying that a long-running tally of the death toll for illegal immigrants trying to get to Europe was now said to be around 20,000.
""These waves of people coming ashore cannot remain an Italian problem. This issue concerns everyone. Just as the mayor of Lampedusa urged [prime minister Enrico] Letta to ""come and count the dead with us""... so should the same cry be directed at Brussels,"" he wrote.
Rome's La Repubblica published an interview with Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge, who is Congolese-born and the first black minister to serve in Italy's cabinet.
She told the paper that ""I could have been on that boat"" and that it was time to review Italy's 2002 immigration law, which introduced criminal sanctions for those caught entering the country illegally.
Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano on its front page echoed the words of Pope Francis, who described the disaster as ""a disgrace which must not be repeated"".
In Germany, Christian Jakob said in Berlin's Die Tageszeitung: ''In the face of the catastrophe everyone is blaming unprincipled people smugglers, or is even demanding 'national mourning'. But it's clear what must be done... Europe must open itself up again to those seeking shelter. Otherwise the dying will continue.''
Klaus Huhold in Austria's Wiener Zeitung said: ''Europe's present immigration policy tries to make it as hard as possible for refugees to get to Europe in the first place... The tragedy of Lampedusa proves again how ineffective this policy is and the deadly consequences it can bring. Whoever sees a journey on a wooden boat to Lampedusa as his last chance will take that chance - no matter how dangerous it might be.''
In Switzerland's TagesAnzeiger, Stephan Israel said: ""Countries without external borders - such as Germany or Switzerland - can no longer leave it to the exposed Italians, Spanish or Greeks to deal with the refugee trek. Some more solidarity would make the horror at the daily drama on the margins of affluence more credible.''
Spain's El Pais reported on the sinking and said: ""The only thing that is different is the number. A number sufficiently high to be dressed up with big words of mourning and alarm; an endless line of dead without names at the start of the TV news. The rest happens every day.''
Somali websites carried factual reports on the sinking: ""More than 130 Africans including Somalis died in Lampedusa"" (Shabeelle); ""Boat carrying 500 immigrants sinks in Italian shore"" (Dayniile); ""Three-hundred African immigrants killed in Italy's Lampedusa sinking"" (Jowhar) and ""Death toll in Lampedusa sinking reaches 300"" (Midnimo).

The Awate.com news website, for example, featured some brief articles about the incident, but overall, there was limited coverage of the event. This lack of media attention is concerning, as it suggests a lack of importance placed on the lives of African migrants by their own countries and the media that represent them.

The media's role in shaping public opinion and bringing attention to important issues is crucial, especially in situations where lives are at stake. The drowning of hundreds of migrants should have been a wake-up call for African nations to address the root causes of migration and implement policies to prevent such tragedies. However, the lack of media coverage indicates a failure to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and take necessary action.

The indifference exhibited by the media also raises questions about the prevalent narrative surrounding migration in Africa. It is often overlooked or reduced to a simplistic portrayal of desperate individuals seeking a better life. This harmful narrative ignores the complex factors that drive people to leave their homes, such as political instability, economic inequality, and conflict. By not giving adequate attention to incidents like the sinking of the fishing vessel, the media perpetuates this simplistic portrayal, further marginalizing African migrants and denying them their right to be recognized as individuals with unique stories and aspirations.

Moreover, the lack of media coverage also highlights the global disparities in the value placed on human lives. If a similar tragedy had occurred in a Western country, it would have received widespread media attention and sparked international outcry. However, the lives of African migrants, already marginalized and devalued, seem to be easily forgotten and disregarded.

In order to address this issue, it is crucial for African media outlets to play a more responsible and proactive role in reporting on migration-related incidents. They have a duty to shed light on the stories of African migrants, not only to create awareness but also to stimulate dialogue and influence policy changes. Additionally, international media organizations should also prioritize the coverage of such incidents, ensuring that the voices and experiences of African migrants are given the attention and respect they deserve. Only through increased media attention and public awareness can we hope to see the necessary changes and improvements in the treatment and perception of African migrants."
"But an education project is trying to improve the skills and qualifications of seafarers, in a way that is compatible with this floating workplace.
For any of us who have used ferries, it's often a rather insulated experience - less boat and more mobile tunnel or maritime service station. You drive on at one end, maybe spend some time in a cafe and shop, and then rush off the other end.
But what holidaymakers don't see is that the ship is where dozens of people live. Even though the ferries shuttle back and forth across the each day, crews stay on board for a fortnight at a time.
On a blustery crossing on a DFDS ferry on the Dover to Dunkirk run, you can see it's a way of life as much as a job.
Training is important for the shipping industry. There are crew members from many different countries and backgrounds, with varying levels of skill and qualifications. Training is needed to keep up with changing technology and to protect safety.
But in terms of a workplace classroom, it is literally cut off.
An often unrecognised part of maritime life is the absence of reliable internet access for the crew. There isn't much bandwidth. And, quite often, for the crew, there is no online connection.
A project between shipping companies, the Marine Society charity and the RMT union has developed a customised approach to on-board lessons.
A software company, Coracle, has produced digital, distance-learning courses that can be used offline by the crew in their downtime.
And then, as soon as the ship is in reach of a signal, it can synchronise and update. It's a mobile phone app, but without needing to have a mobile connection.
There are lessons in areas such as maths, literacy, English language and the rules of the sea, with courses such as Maths@Sea based around the specific needs of seafarers.
Delivering training for a crew at sea is a challenge for the shipping industry around the world.
And these @Sea courses have been shortlisted for an award that will be judged by the general secretary of the International Maritime Organisation.
James Tweed, the founder of Coracle, previously chartered oil tankers. He says one of the biggest lessons from this was how little the general public knew about the sea and the lives of those who work on ships.
He calls this ""sea blindness"". If you're reading this article on a laptop or a tablet computer, Mr Tweed says, it probably arrived from Asia after a month-long sea voyage. But it's a case of out of sight and out of mind for a public that never sees the journey.
""For an island nation, the majority of people have no idea what happens beyond the swimming-trunks' depth of the shoreline,"" he says.
The training project, delivering e-learning without the internet, he says, is filling a gap for an industry that badly needs help with new skills.
""The education technology world has missed them. It's invisible, because no-one knows what the industry looks like.""
Shipping crews can have plenty of practical experience, but might well have few qualifications or ways to measure what skills might need to be updated.
Mr Tweed gives the example of the fishing industry.
""The reality of the fishing fleet decline is really profound. You've got a group of people, generation after generation, following a particular path, and in many cases their industry has just gone.
""They understand the life at sea, but educationally the system has moved on.
""How do you get someone who dropped out of the education system as a teenager back into it, so they can qualify in an industry that they're suited to?""
Nicola Steer, training and human resources officer for DFDS, says there are often no real equivalences for the qualifications in the shipping industry.
A ship's captain will have studied in maritime college, taken tough exams and gathered years of experience at sea - but when they apply for a job on shore, it isn't recognised in the same way as a university degree.
From the perspective of the Danish-based shipping company, Ms Steer says, the training project is very valuable. It allows crew members to improve themselves and advance their careers.
She says the company wants to ""create a culture where everyone is learning"".
But it's also a way for it to develop talent from within their own ranks.
When she goes to careers fairs, she says, there is often little understanding of jobs in the shipping industry. Recruitment can be a challenge, so training existing staff becomes more important.
The crew on board a ship occupy their own self-contained world, with their own sleeping quarters and places of work, such as the hi-tech airiness of the bridge, the rattle of the kitchens and the heat and noise of the engine rooms.
Head chef Les Potts says people working in the ship's galley have to be both cooks and seafarers.
Getting the right crew can be a challenge, and he says there are big benefits from being able to train their own staff.
You also have to be ready to make an awful lot of fish and chips. Mr Potts says that no matter what they try on the menu, it's fish and chips that remains the most popular.
Day-release courses are not possible at sea, so the ship has to become a floating training centre.
Joe Butler is an apprentice on board, training to be a marine engineer. His new classroom is the engine room, where he learns about the workings of the huge, thumpingly loud engines.
Ship's engineer Rihards Ellers, sitting in front of a bank of computer screens, says his job is becoming increasingly technical and staff need to keep updating their skills.
There is also another huge difference in these working lives. And that's the sea itself and all its unpredictability.
Ms Steer has been promoted to a job on shore, but she says she still misses the unique life of a ship at sea. ""I absolutely miss it every day,"" she says.","But an education project is trying to improve the skills and qualifications of seafarers, in a way that is compatible with this floating workplace. For any of us who have never worked on a ship, it can be difficult to imagine the unique challenges and requirements that seafarers face on a daily basis. However, this education project aims to bridge that gap and ensure that seafarers receive the necessary training and education to excel in their roles.

One of the main objectives of this project is to enhance the technical skills of seafarers. This includes providing them with up-to-date knowledge of the latest maritime technologies and equipment. With rapid advancements in the shipping industry, it is crucial for seafarers to stay informed and learn how to operate and maintain increasingly complex machinery.

Another focus of the education project is improving the navigational skills of seafarers. Navigating a ship is no small feat, as it requires a deep understanding of naval charts, weather patterns, and communication protocols. This project aims to provide comprehensive training in these areas, ensuring that seafarers can confidently navigate through various conditions and scenarios.

Additionally, the project aims to enhance the safety qualifications of seafarers. Working on a ship comes with inherent risks, and seafarers need to be prepared to handle emergencies and ensure the well-being of all onboard. This project focuses on providing seafarers with comprehensive safety training, including first aid, fire-fighting, and crisis management.

Furthermore, the education project recognizes the importance of soft skills development for seafarers. Communication, teamwork, leadership, and cultural awareness are all essential skills for successful collaboration onboard a ship. The project offers training in these areas to ensure that seafarers can effectively navigate diverse international environments and work cohesively with crew members from different backgrounds.

In summary, this education project aims to equip seafarers with the necessary skills and qualifications to thrive in the ever-evolving maritime industry. By focusing on technical knowledge, navigational expertise, safety qualifications, and soft skills development, the project strives to create competent and capable seafarers who can excel in their floating workplace."

He was ""behaving strangely"" and was asked to leave, prosecutor Kevin West said.
However when his victim joined him outside Mulryan called her a ""slag"" and a ""bitch"" and punched her to the ground.
He damaged two cars in the street as he left before the owner of one vehicle caught him, knocking him unconscious.
In a statement his victim said she had been left feeling ""very vulnerable"" after the attack, adding: ""Scouse accents give me panic attacks.""
It is not yet known if she suffered permanent eye damage.
""He remembers very little. He feels extremely remorseful,"" Shaun Esprit, defending Mulryan, said.
At the time of the attack Mulryan, who had 49 previous convictions for 113 offences, was in breach of an eight-week suspended sentence for assaulting a police officer.
He also pleaded guilty to criminal damage to the cars.
Mulryan was jailed for three years and nine months, with a further one month to run consecutively for breaching his licence terms.

Mulryan, who was known to the woman and had a history of violent behavior, was arrested shortly after the incident.

The assault took place at a local pub where both Mulryan and the woman were socializing. Witnesses reported that Mulryan had been heavily intoxicated and was becoming increasingly aggressive throughout the night. As tensions escalated, he suddenly lashed out at the woman, striking her in the face with a powerful punch.

The force of Mulryan's blow left the woman unconscious and bleeding profusely from her injuries. Bystanders rushed to her aid and immediately called for an ambulance. She was taken to the nearby hospital, where doctors discovered she had suffered two fractures to her eye socket.

Police apprehended Mulryan near the scene, as witnesses were able to provide a clear description of him and his whereabouts. He was charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm and faced a potential prison sentence if found guilty.

During the trial, the court heard evidence of Mulryan's past violent behavior and aggressive tendencies. It was revealed that he had been involved in numerous altercations and had previously faced charges for assault.

The victim bravely took the witness stand during the trial, recounting the traumatic experience and the impact it had on her life. She expressed her fear of encountering Mulryan again and emphasized the necessity for justice to be served.

After careful deliberation, the jury found Mulryan guilty of assault causing grievous bodily harm. The judge, considering Mulryan's previous offenses and the severity of the attack, sentenced him to five years in prison.

"Ministers say they are responding to concern that the devices - which can contain nicotine - normalise smoking and undermine the smoking ban.
A minimum alcohol price of 50p per unit is also proposed in a white paper of ideas for public health legislation.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the aim was to address some of the nation's major public health challenges.
By Owain ClarkeBBC Wales health correspondent
It's now generally accepted that the smoking ban has had a positive health impact overall.
But as part of what it calls a radical new law to improve public health, the Welsh government is now turning its attention from tobacco to electronic cigarettes.
Sales of e-cigarettes have boomed in recent years - supporters claim they're much safer than ordinary cigarettes and can help some people quit.
Certain pubs, cafes and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff have already banned e-cigs.
The Welsh government wants to restrict their use only to places where you can legally smoke tobacco  - for example outside or in smoking shelters.
Ministers claims e-cigarettes give the impression that smoking in public is normal and acceptable.  It also argues that children could be tempted to try them, which could lead to nicotine addiction and be a gateway to smoking.
However opponents of the move claim that link isn't proven and the proposed law could stigmatise people who are trying to give up.
""Taking concerted, collective action to address public health concerns remains one of the most powerful contributions any government can make to the welfare and wellbeing of its population,"" he said.
""Alcohol and tobacco contribute to many life-threatening illnesses and are major causes of persistent inequalities in health.
""I have concerns about the impact of e-cigarettes on the enforcement of Wales' smoking ban. That's why we are proposing restricting their use in enclosed public places.
""I am also concerned that their use in enclosed public places could normalise smoking behaviour.
""E-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, and I want to minimise the risk of a new generation becoming addicted to this drug.""
However Richard Filbrandt, e-cigarette user and co-owner of the Vibrant Vapour cafe in Carmarthen, said they had studies showing there was no risk to passive smokers.
""There are studies done by Air for Change in America that say it doesn't warrant withdrawing them from public places, and they are the same people that said take cigarettes away from public places,"" he told BBC News.
""Why should we be treated like smokers? Why should we be put out at risk of passive smoking ourselves in a smoking area when we do not smoke?""
Welsh Conservatives described the ban as a ""step backwards"" for quitters.
Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: ""There is a clear danger that forcing someone outside into a smoker's hut will put them in temptation's way and harm their health due to second-hand smoke exposure.""
On the subject of alcohol, Mr Drakeford said there was ""indisputable evidence that the price of alcohol matters"".
""It's no coincidence that as the affordability of alcohol has increased substantially, so has alcohol-related death and disease,"" he said.
""A minimum unit price will make a strong contribution to preventing alcohol overuse and misuse and reducing alcohol-associated illnesses.""
Other proposals in the white paper, which will be subject to consultation, include;
Chief Medical Officer Dr Ruth Hussey said: ""On the seventh anniversary of the smoking ban, it is symbolic that Wales is once again at the forefront of a new set of radical proposals to improve public health.""
The white paper - Listening to you: Your health matters - is open to consultation until 24 June.","Ministers say they are responding to concern that the devices - which can contain nicotine - normalise smoking and undermine the smoking ban. A minimum alcohol price of 50p per unit will be introduced in England and Wales in an attempt to tackle problems caused by excessive drinking, ministers have said. The new measure is aimed at preventing cheap alcohol from being sold and consumed, reducing alcohol-related harm and encouraging responsible drinking. The move follows successful implementations of minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland and other countries."
"He said the damage to Hong Kong could be ""immeasurable"" if they were blocked.
The government hopes to pass reforms enabling public elections for the territory's leader in 2017. Under the reforms, a committee will nominate candidates who will run for the post.
Pro-democracy lawmakers have criticised the reforms and vowed to veto them.
They argue that the reforms only offer residents ""fake democracy"".
Late last year, thousands of activists held a two-month protest against the proposed political reforms.
Forbes magazine estimates Mr Li's wealth from his property, energy, retail, ports and technology businesses at $33.5bn (Â£22.1bn).
He made his comments after announcing the re-organisation of his companies, moving their base from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean.
""Damage could be immeasurable for Hong Kong if the constitutional reform stays where it is and makes no headway,"" he said.
""The constitutional reform has to make a step forward. If not, all Hong Kong people, including me, will be big losers. Both you and me.
""I hope the constitutional reform will pass under any circumstance. This is the first step. If there's no first step, then where is the second step? How can we push forward democracy?""
China's government has agreed to public elections for Hong Kong's leader for the first time in 2017, but has ruled that there should only be two to three candidates, chosen by a pro-Beijing committee.
The Chinese government's ruling prompting mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which drew tens of thousands at their peak.
To enable public elections in 2017, the Hong Kong government needs to pass a political reform package in the territory's legislative council.
However, pro-democracy lawmakers hold enough seats for a veto, and have vowed to vote down any package that is based on the Chinese government's ruling. They say the central government's requirements restrict who can run for the post.
If the political reforms are voted down, Hong Kong's current system, where the leader is chosen by an election committee of 1,200 people, will continue.","He said the damage to Hong Kong could be ""immeasurable"" if they were blocked. The government hopes to pass reforms enabling public elections for the territory's leader in 2017. Under the current proposal, the Hong Kong Chief Executive would be elected by popular vote, but only after a screening process carried out by a nominating committee. Pro-democracy activists argue that this system would still allow the Chinese government to control the election process and limit candidates who are critical of Beijing. They have been demanding genuine universal suffrage, where all candidates can run regardless of their stance towards the Chinese government. Protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2014, with demonstrators occupying key parts of the city for weeks, demanding greater democratic rights. The Chinese government condemned the protests, labeling them as illegal and disruptive. The outcome of these reforms remains uncertain as tensions between pro-democracy activists and the Chinese government continue to escalate."
"The company said criminals had used the notorious Angler Exploit malware tool to target tens of thousands of users every day.
The attacks were focused on customers of hosting provider Limestone Networks.
Cisco has issued a patch and published guidance on how users' can protect themselves but analysts doubt this will put an end to Angler attacks.
""We shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking Cisco's action will serve a killer blow to the Angler Exploit Kit, but it will have bloodied its nose and disrupted the criminals' activities,"" security expert Graham Cluley told the BBC.
Cisco's security team discovered the fraud during a wide-reaching investigation into Angler - one of ""the most advanced and concerning hacking tools on the market"", according to the firm.
The malware takes advantage of vulnerabilities in Flash, Java and other browser plug-ins to break into systems.
It can then take computers hostage, demanding a ransom be paid by their owners in order to regain access to the device.
Cisco estimates that almost half of the Angler attacks it analysed happened on servers connecting to the US-based hosting provider.
It said fraudsters were targeting an estimated 90,000 people a day and generating more than $30m annually from the attacks.
Ken Munro, a security expert at Pen Test Partners, said Cisco's investigation was ""another great example of cutting off malware at the knees"".
He added: ""By analysing the data around Angler and finding critical compromised servers on the internet that the exploit needs to communicate with, it can be rendered powerless.""
But he said it would not take long for malware authors to ""rewrite their tools to work around this"".
He said: ""It's a running battle that will continue in a slightly modified format.""
Cisco estimates the total revenue generated by Angler attacks worldwide could exceed $60m annually.","The company said criminals had used the notorious Angler Exploit malware tool to target tens of thousands of users every day.

"The ex-Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender said he could ""bring something new to the table"" as the Conservative nomination.
He said he wanted to ""change London for everybody"" but acknowledged he would not be a ""frontrunner"".
Campbell, 40, will take part in a hustings event with other candidates for the Tory nomination on 4 July.
Boris Johnson is planning to stand down as London Mayor in 2016.
Campbell, who also played for Portsmouth and Newcastle, told the Sun: ""I'm going in with my eyes wide open. I know I'm not going to be a frontrunner.
""But I look at people who have been in politics for five, 10, 15 years, and muck up, you see them muck up and think, 'You guys are supposed to be pro!'
""People [who] have gone to Oxbridge, had thousands spent on their education, and I mean they are royally mucking up,"" he said.
Asked whether he could count on the votes of Spurs fans still bitter over his 2001 move to north London rivals Arsenal, Campbell said: ""If we keep thinking about football, we're not going to do anything.
""We are dealing with people's lives here. I want to change London for everybody.""
The Conservative Way Forward group confirmed that Campbell had signed up to take part in its mayoral hustings next month.
""We are delighted that candidates like Sol Campbell are throwing their hat in the ring and coming to debate the future of London at our hustings on 4 July,"" a spokesman said.
Also in the running for the Tory candidacy are entrepreneur Ivan Massow, current deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh and London Assembly member Andrew Boff, while MP Zac Goldsmith has also been tipped as a potential challenger.","The ex-Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender said he could ""bring something new to the table"" as the Conservative nomination. He said he wanted to ""change London for everybody"" but acknowledged that his lack of experience in politics could be a hurdle. He expressed his belief that his sports background had taught him valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and leadership, which he felt could be beneficial in the political arena.

The former footballer highlighted the importance of tackling crime and improving housing in London, two issues he felt passionate about. He also emphasized the need for better opportunities for young people and addressing the ever-growing wealth inequality in the city.

Despite his ambitions, the ex-footballer recognized that his lack of political knowledge and experience might make his journey challenging. However, he remained confident that his unique perspective and dedication to bringing positive change would resonate with voters.

While many were initially skeptical of a former athlete venturing into politics, some supporters praised his commitment and enthusiasm. They argued that fresh voices and perspectives were needed to address the pressing issues facing London.

Ultimately, the ex-Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender hoped that his passion for London and desire for positive change would convince people to give him a chance, allowing him to make a meaningful impact on the city as a Conservative candidate."
"Culture Secretary John Whittingdale is expected to set out a tougher regime for the broadcaster in plans for a new royal charter for the next 11 years.
Reports have claimed the BBC will scale back online services, including losing recipe pages and magazine content.
The BBC said it was reviewing online services but such claims were ""speculation"".
The royal charter expires at the end of December and a public consultation into its future was launched last year.
Earlier in May, Labour accused Mr Whittingdale of ""meddling"", following reports he would allow commercial broadcasters to challenge the BBC over peak-time scheduling, a claim that was denied.
Mr Whittingdale, speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, said media reports ahead of the publication of the paper had ranged from ""complete fantasy"" to ""quite well-informed"", adding: ""But certainly not informed by me or my department.""
A government source told the Sunday Times the White Paper was intended to ""set a broad set of principles and guidelines"".
""How that is applied to individual programmes and scheduling is a matter for them. But they will be subject to external regulation.""
The Guardian has claimed the licence fee would be subjected to ""top-slicing"", with a portion of it being handed to commercial rivals in areas such as children's programming.
Newspapers have also speculated Mr Whittingdale will make the BBC publish how much it pays top talent earning more than Â£150,000.
At Sunday night's TV Bafta awards, Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky was one of a number of people who spoke out against alleged government plans.
He claimed ministers were trying to ""eviscerate"" the BBC and that now was ""a dangerous time for broadcasting in Britain"".
In a speech at the British Museum, Prime Minister David Cameron said the broadcaster was one of the ""most recognised brands on the planet"", while Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester of Herne Hill warned a public protest march would follow any ""stupid"" decisions in regards to the BBC's future.
The White Paper is also expected to address the conclusions of Sir David Clementi's report into the BBC Trust, which recommended ""fundamental reform"" of the body.
The document follows 2015's Green Paper, which was a consultation paper about the future of the corporation.
In that paper, Mr Whittingdale said there was a ""need to ask some hard questions in charter review if we are to ensure the future success of the BBC and, indeed, UK broadcasting"".
""I believe the BBC can continue to thrive. But to do that it will need to evolve,"" he said.
In an email to staff, BBC director general Tony Hall said the White Paper ""must give us a mandate for a secure future"".
He said he would address staff following the paper's publication.
Lord Hall wrote: ""It's a big moment. Of course, every Charter matters - but perhaps this one even more so, as it's taking place in the middle of a global media revolution.""
He said the BBC must have a ""certainty of funding, as well as control over its own revenue streams"".
""This debate should lead us to a position where our creativity can flourish rather than be constrained...
""We need to change the way we're governed to make it simpler and clearer. But, any changes must protect the independence of the BBC.""
Meanwhile, the corporation has announced the commissioning, publishing and some of the production of BBC Three's short-form content is to move from London to  Birmingham by 2018.
The TV channel, which became online-only in February, will create new commissioner and assistant commissioner roles in the city.
Birmingham will also be the home of a team within BBC News supplying content for BBC Three's Daily Drop web stream.
The BBC said its proposed partnerships with local news organisations are also expected to be based in Birmingham, alongside the existing English Regions HQ.","Culture Secretary John Whittingdale is expected to set out a tougher regime for the broadcaster in plans for a new royal charter for the next 11 years. Reports have claimed that Whittingdale will propose significant changes to the BBC's governance structure, funding model, and the role of the BBC Trust. These changes are said to include replacing the BBC Trust with a new unitary board, which would be responsible for setting the broadcaster's strategic direction and overseeing its operations. Additionally, the BBC would be required to disclose the salaries of its top stars earning over £150,000 per year and may also face restrictions on the extent of its online services. The proposals are expected to be controversial and may face resistance from BBC supporters and industry experts."

But, former chief executive Mike Robinson told the hearing Ms Whitmore was never asked to hide any facts.
Ms Whitmore, 49, was made redundant from her post as assistant director of organisation and governance in June.
Mr Robinson, who was chief executive between 2014 and 2016, said he had asked her to investigate the sale of council-owned Acklam Hall because there were accusations being made on social media and in the press.
A few weeks later she came back to him to say there had been no illegal action or corruption, he said.
The hearing had earlier been told about claims of a ""laddish culture"" at the council, with senior managers referring to women as ""posh birds"" and ""fatties"", but Mr Robinson said he did not recognise that language or behaviour.
He described the council as a ""good place to work"", and was unaware of any bullying that took place at the council during his time as chief executive.

Whitmore, who held the position of chief executive at an undisclosed organization, asserted that she was subject to intense pressure to ignore the irregularities in the process of selling off some properties. These alleged flaws in the sale included potential illegalities and violations of ethical business practices.

According to Whitmore, she chose to speak up against these irregularities, prompting her superiors to retaliate against her. She claims that she experienced bullying tactics aimed at silencing her and preventing any further scrutiny of the questionable sales.

The former executive believes that her refusal to turn a blind eye to these flaws caused significant discomfort for some key individuals within the organization who were benefiting from the flawed sales. As a result, she faced threats and harassment, which ultimately led to her departure from the company.

"Forces loyal to Vice-President Riek Machar say government troops attacked their positions in the capital, Juba.
But Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said the reports of war were ""dishonest"".
The UN mission said hundreds had sought shelter in its compounds, and called for leaders to restrain their troops.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called the ""senseless violence"". The UN Security Council is holding an emergency session to discuss South Sudan.
Col William Gatjiath, Mr Machar's military spokesman, told the BBC President Salva Kiir ""isn't serious"" about a peace agreement.
He said ""hundreds"" of Mr Machar's troops had died on Sunday, and that troops loyal to Mr Machar were advancing on Juba from different directions.
Mr Lueth said government troops responded when Mr Machar's forces attacked a checkpoint, adding that those forces had now been scattered. ""The situation is normal and it is under full control,"" he added.
The clashes follow days of fighting in the world's newest country between supporters of Mr Kiir and Mr Machar.
At least 150 people were killed in fighting on Friday, before calm was restored on Saturday. Local radio station Radio Tamazuj reported on Sunday that the death toll from those clashes may be as high as 271.

South Sudan: Obstacles to a lasting peace
Why does S Sudan matter so much to the US?
The violence has raised fears of renewed instability, with a 2015 peace deal failing to quell unrest.
Heavy gunfire was reported on Sunday near a military barracks occupied by troops loyal to Mr Machar.
Friday's exchanges were apparently sparked by a shootout between Mr Kiir's and Mr Machar's bodyguards. The two men met at the presidential palace on Friday, and issued a call for calm.
July 2011 - South Sudan becomes an independent country, after more than 20 years of guerrilla warfare, which claimed the lives of at least 1.5 million people and displaced more than four million.
December 2013 - Civil war breaks out after President Salva Kiir sacks the cabinet and accuses Vice-President Riek Machar of planning a coup. The war is fought broadly between the country's biggest ethnic groups - the Dinka, led by Mr Kiir, and the Nuer, under Mr Machar.
More than 2.2 million people are displaced by the fighting. Famine puts the lives of thousands at risk. Tens of thousands of people are reported killed, and Mr Machar flees the country.
August 2015 - President Kiir signs a peace deal with rebels after a threat of sanctions from the UN.
April 2016 - Mr Machar returns to South Sudan to take up his job as first vice president in a new unity government led by President Kiir.
The move marks ""the end of the war and the return of peace and stability to South Sudan"", Mr Kiir says.
The situation in South Sudan has echoes of the days before the civil war began, in December 2013, when skirmishes between troops loyal to Mr Kiir and Mr Machar escalated into a national bloodbath, killing tens of thousands and displacing two million.
As artillery fire rings out in the capital Juba and a helicopter gunship buzzes overhead, desperate work is under way to try to calm the situation and to prevent the clashes from spreading.
But huge distrust remains between Mr Kiir and Mr Machar and between their forces. The leaders may even be struggling to control their own troops. A number of peace deals have been signed - so far, none has led to lasting stability.
One foreign worker in the Gudele district, on the outskirts of the city, told the BBC he was waiting to be evacuated from the area.
He said shooting restarted at 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Sunday, and had been sporadic throughout the day.
In the latest response:
South Sudan marked its fifth anniversary of independence from neighbouring Sudan on Saturday in lockdown.
The country is so short of money that no official anniversary events were planned.","Forces loyal to Vice-President Riek Machar say government troops attacked their positions in the capital, Juba. But Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said the reports of war were ""dishonest"". The government of South Sudan has been plagued by conflict and power struggles since gaining independence in 2011. Vice-President Riek Machar, who represents a rival faction, accused government troops of initiating an attack on their positions in the capital, Juba.

However, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth dismissed these claims as ""dishonest."" It is unclear what exactly Lueth meant by ""dishonest,"" but he may be implying that the reports of the attack are false or exaggerated. This suggests that the government denies any involvement in the alleged attack.

The conflicting reports highlight the deep divisions and lack of trust between various factions within the South Sudanese government. This ongoing power struggle has resulted in numerous outbreaks of violence and has hindered the country's ability to achieve long-term stability.

It is worth noting that South Sudan has a history of ethnic tensions, especially between the Dinka and Nuer communities, to which President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar respectively belong. These tensions have often fueled political disputes and manifested in violent clashes, further complicating the situation.

The latest reports of an attack on Machar's positions in Juba underscore the fragile state of affairs in South Sudan. The country is in dire need of a peaceful resolution to the conflict and sustainable political stability to ensure the well-being of its people and promote economic development."

The cars affected were produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and between April 2006 and December 2014.
Global carmaker have for years been hampered by recalls of airbags made by Takata.
Toyota said it was calling back 1.47 million airbags in cars sold in Europe, 1.16 million in Japan, 820,000 in China, and 2.35 million in other regions excluding the US.
Toyota's recall on Wednesday brings its total of recalled Takata airbags to 23.1 million. So far, a total of 12 carmakers have had to recall vehicles because of faulty Takata airbags, with the total number of recalls expected to exceed 100 million cars.
Car parts maker Takata is already facing huge compensation costs over its airbags, which are used by many car manufacturers and have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide.
US regulators believe the volatile chemical used in the inflators, ammonium nitrate, can cause airbags to explode with excessive force.
Several automakers, including Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Ford have said they will stop using Takata airbags containing ammonium nitrate in future models.
Takata also produces seatbelts, child seats, and other safety-related car parts.","The models include the Corolla and the Yaris subcompact models, most of them sold in Japan, China and Europe. The cars affected were produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and they were found to have a faulty airbag inflator manufactured by Takata Corporation. The faulty inflators have the potential to explode, sending shrapnel into the vehicle cabin, posing serious injury or even death to the occupants.

Toyota issued a recall for these models in March 2020, urging owners to bring their vehicles to authorized dealerships to have the defective airbags replaced. The recall affected approximately 3.4 million vehicles worldwide, including around 2.9 million in Japan.

This recall is part of a larger global recall of vehicles equipped with Takata airbags, which have been linked to numerous deaths and injuries worldwide. The Takata airbag recall is one of the largest and most complex recalls in automotive history, affecting over 19 automakers and millions of vehicles globally.

Toyota has been actively working to ensure the safety of its customers and has been continuously cooperating with relevant authorities in conducting extensive investigations and recalls. The company has set up a dedicated website for customers to check if their vehicles are affected by any global recalls, including the Takata airbag recall.

Owners of affected Toyota models are advised to contact their nearest authorized dealership or visit the company's official website for more information on how to get their vehicles inspected and"

GB fell 0.273 marks short of the 45.223 target set by their governing body. An appeal to raise that score was refused.
""Nobody thought it would come to this,"" said British gymnast Rachel Smith.
British Gymnastics performance director Tim Jones confirmed GB will not be sending a team to the Olympic group event as a result of Tuesday's failure.
The margin between the greatest success they could have imagined, reaching their home Olympic Games, and the horror of failure after all that time and money, could scarcely have been smaller
Read Ollie's blog here
""We went through a process with the British Olympic Association (BOA) of agreeing a standard we felt would show credible performance,"" Jones, on the point of tears, told BBC Sport.
""It would have been a score that gave us a platform to launch rhythmic into the next four years, but there wasn't any leeway. They will not be nominated [for London 2012].
""After yesterday, we thought the girls were in a pretty strong position to make the mark we'd agreed with the BOA.
""There were one or two minor errors and they've come up a small amount short. I'm hugely disappointed for them.""
The six-strong British team came into the second half of qualifying with an overnight score of 23.100, more than halfway to the mark they needed to hit to ensure they were sent to London 2012.
British Gymnastics' guide to rhythmic
GB rhythmic group's official site
But early errors in their hoop and ribbon routine cost them points that proved vital as they scored just 21.850 to fall agonisingly short.
The squad, aiming to be the first ever to compete for Britain in the rhythmic gymnastics group event at an Olympics, huddled behind a black curtain away from the crowd after their result became clear.
Britain then launched an appeal, but coach Sarah Moon admitted it had been more in hope than expectation.
""We were just hoping,"" she said. ""It's such a fine margin of error, less than one element [of the routine]. That's one judge making one different decision.""
While both British Gymnastics and the BOA made it very clear that this marked the end of the group's Olympic hopes, the gymnasts themselves appeared unclear about their future and adamant they could still reach London 2012.
""We're ready to come back tomorrow to everyone that we deserve to go. It can't just be done on that. We need to prove tomorrow that we should be at the Olympics,"" said Smith.
""This isn't the last you're going to see of this group. We'll carry on training, we'll go to other competitions, we'll show to everyone - we can do it. We're not messing around. Nobody's having a joke here. We're being serious. We want to go.""
Team-mate Lynne Hutchison added: ""I really thought we had it. I thought we were going to do it. But not today. I don't think it's the end, we can show a credible performance, show we're good enough and hopefully we might get something.""
This isn't the last you're going to see of this group
However, BBC Sport understands results on Wednesday or at any future date in the run-up to the Games will have no bearing on the group's Olympic fortunes. Their chances rested entirely on Tuesday's results.
The British squad, based in Bath, had almost entirely funded themselves with the help of parents, having not qualified for funding from UK Sport.
The British Olympic Association took the step of bringing in ice dancing legends Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in December, who coached the gymnasts on their artistry in a bid to help them sway the judges in their favour.
In the individual rhythmic event, which is separate, Francesca Jones is still expected to compete at London 2012 for Britain.
Jones, who represented Wales at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, finished last of 25 at the test event with a score of 88.600, 21 points behind Russian victor Daria Kondakova.
Unlike the Britons competing in the group event, Jones reached last year's World Championships, which proved enough to get the nod to compete at the Olympics. Her scores at the test event do not affect Britain's place in the individual event at the Games.","Media playback is not supported on this device GB fell 0.273 marks short of the 45.223 target set by their governing body.

Relive Everton's loss at home to West Brom
All the reaction to Saturday's games
Having won their past two in the Premier League before this game, there was optimism around Goodison Park that Everton may be in with a shout for a Europa League spot, especially after seeing fifth-placed Manchester United lose.
But the Toffees were wasteful against West Brom, chalking up 34 shots in the match without managing to find the net. Only six of those were on target and they have now lost six games at home in the league.
Having had 76% possession, they could count themselves unlucky when striking the woodwork twice, but top scorer Romelu Lukaku failed to add to his 16 goals in the top flight, being well shackled by the visitor's defence.
Barkley tried to exert his influence but with the opposition back line sitting deep, the England international was made to shoot from long range.
There were a smattering of boos from the home supporters at the final whistle, frustrated that their side failed to build on their recent good form and dropping to 10th in the table.
Tony Pulis's side went into the game on the back of a poor run which had seen them looking over their shoulder at the relegation zone, but they did manage to scrape past Peterborough on penalties in the fourth round of the FA Cup in their last game.
A disciplined display against wave after wave of Everton attacks saw them pick up three points and climb up to 13th in the league, eight points above the drop zone.
Centre-back Jonas Olsson was the bedrock on which their clean sheet was based, thwarting the Merseysiders throughout the game. The Swede made a match-high 17 clearances and six blocks.
Having gone three of their past four games without a shot on target, they needed just one in this match, as Rondon's opportunistic effort from the goalline in the 14th minute gave them victory.
Everton boss Roberto Martinez: ""We didn't do anything wrong. Their one shot on target ends up in the back of the net.
""The effort and the way that we play the game I couldn't fault. It is one of those moments in football sometimes that are difficult to explain.""
""We have been very strong away from home and the points we have achieved is outstanding but we should base our success on making Goodison Park a fortress.""

West Brom boss Tony Pulis: ""Everton are a top four or five team. The depth of quality within the club is fantastic, they had a great performance to beat Stoke last week and to come here and put in that performance is fantastic.

"Ms Hamilton was elected as a list MSP for the South of Scotland in 2016, but hopes to win the constituency seat vacated by Tory colleague John Lamont.
The Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire by-election will be held on 8 June, the same day as the snap general election.
Ms Hamilton's list seat remains with the Conservatives, with Michelle Ballantyne next on the list.
She leads the Conservative group on Borders Council, so a decision on whether she takes up the Holyrood seat will not be taken until after Thursday's council elections.
The Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire by-election was triggered by the resignation of Mr Lamont, who is contesting the corresponding Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency in the Westminster election.
He is seeking to unseat the SNP's Calum Kerr, who has the slimmest majority in Scotland of 328 votes or 0.6% from the 2015 vote. Also contesting that election are former Labour MP Ian Davidson and Lib Dem Caroline Burgess.
Meanwhile in the Holyrood seat, which Mr Lamont held with a majority of 23.4% in 2016, Labour have put forward Sally Prentice and the Lib Dems are standing Catriona Bhatia.","Ms Hamilton was elected as a list MSP for the South of Scotland in 2016, but hopes to win the constituency seat vacated by Tory colleague John Lamont.

Ms Hamilton, currently a list Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the South of Scotland region, has expressed her desire to contest the by-election and secure the constituency seat.

By winning the by-election, Ms Hamilton aims to transition from being a list MSP to a constituency MSP. This would allow her to more directly represent and serve the constituents of Ettrick, Roxburgh, and Berwickshire in the Scottish Parliament."
"The pair were fishing when their boat overturned in wind three-quarters of a mile off Walton-on-the-Naze.
Lee Holt, 67, said there had been a ""strong offshore wind"" which had not been so noticeable on shore.
Beach patrol staff sent a jet ski out to right the boat and bring them back in on Tuesday lunchtime.
Mr Holt, from Frinton, had been out with Jim West, 72, from Holland-on-Sea, at their ""normal spot"" near Walton Pier when they flipped over at about 11:30 BST.
Mr Holt said: ""We started drifting towards the Naze and the anchor was not holding, so we decided to pick it up and turn back and as we were doing that we turned over, lost our paddles and rods and ended up in the water.""
Harry Castle, from Tendring District Council's beach patrol team, rode out to get them back in the kayak and tow them to dry land, where Luke Hood helped look after them.
Once they warmed up, they did not require medical treatment.
Mr Holt said: ""The way they continued to care for us was fantastic and we cannot thank them enough.
""One of them even went out again to try to salvage our equipment.""","The pair were fishing when their boat overturned in wind three-quarters of a mile off Walton-on-the-Naze. Lee Holt, 67, said there had been a ""strong offshore wind"" which had not been predicted by forecasters. The two men, Holt and his friend John Marshall, 63, were on a fishing trip off the coast of Walton-on-the-Naze when their boat capsized. According to Holt, the wind was much stronger than anticipated and caused their boat to overturn.

Holt stated that they were about three-quarters of a mile away from the shore when the incident occurred. He mentioned that they were experienced fishermen and had been out in various weather conditions before, but this particular wind caught them off guard.

Fortunately, both men were wearing life jackets and managed to stay afloat until help arrived. The Coastguard was alerted to the situation by a member of the public who saw the boat overturn. They quickly dispatched a lifeboat to rescue the stranded fishermen.

The lifeboat crew had to battle the strong wind and choppy waters to reach the men. It took them around 20 minutes to reach the scene and pull Holt and Marshall out of the water. Both men were cold and shaken but otherwise unharmed.

Holt expressed his gratitude"
"When 15-year-old DeKendrix Warner accidentally stepped into deeper water while wading in the Red River in Shreveport, he panicked.
JaTavious Warner, 17, Takeitha Warner, 13, JaMarcus Warner, 14, Litrelle Stewart, 18, Latevin Stewart, 15, and LaDarius Stewart, 17, rushed to help him and each other.
None of them could swim. All six drowned. DeKendrix was rescued by a passer-by.
Maude Warner, mother of three of the victims, and the other adults present also couldn't swim.
The US has almost 3,500 accidental drownings every year, almost 10 a day.
But according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fatal drowning rate of African-American children aged five-14 is three times that of white children.
A recent study sponsored by USA Swimming uncovered equally stark statistics.
Just under 70% of African-American children surveyed said they had no or low ability to swim. Low ability merely meant they were able to splash around in the shallow end. A further 12% said they could swim but had ""taught themselves"".
The study found 58% of Hispanic children had no or low swimming ability. For white children, the figure was only 42%.
""It is an epidemic that is almost going unnoticed,"" says Sue Anderson, director of  programmes and services at USA Swimming.
The swimming body would like all children to be taught to swim.
Parents' responsibility
""We would like it to be like seatbelts and bicycle helmets,"" says Ms Anderson.
But the situation in the US can vary hugely even within a single state.
Unlike the UK, where learning to swim is enshrined in the national curriculum except in Scotland, the ultimate responsibility in the US often lies with parents.
""I would love to make it a rule like they have in the UK,"" says Cullen Jones, a gold medallist in the freestyle 100m relay in Beijing, and a spokesman for USA Swimming's Make a Splash campaign.
""It isn't a requirement, it isn't a priority in the US.""
Jones's mother took him to swimming lessons after he nearly drowned at a theme park aged five. By eight he was swimming competitively.
The Make a Splash campaign is targeting all non-swimmers and their parents but there is a particular focus on ethnic minority families.
Fear factor
Many black parents are not teaching their children to swim.
Some might assume the fundamental reasons would be lack of money for swimming lessons or living in areas where there were no pools, but the reality is more complex.
""Fear of drowning or fear of injury was really the major variable,"" says Prof Carol Irwin, a sociologist from the University of Memphis, who led the study for USA Swimming.
Typically, those children who could not swim also had parents who could not swim.
""Parents who don't know how to swim are very likely to pass on not knowing how to swim to their children,"" says Ms Anderson.
In focus groups for the study, Prof Irwin said many black parents who could not swim evinced sentiments like: ""My children are never going to learn to swim because I'm scared they would drown.""
The parents' very fear of their children drowning was making that fate more likely.
The major reason behind the problem could lie in the era of segregation says Prof Jeff Wiltse, author of Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America.
""The history of discriminationâ€¦ has contributed to the drowning and swimming rates,"" says Prof Wiltse.
In his work he identified two periods of a boom in swimming rates in the US - in the 1920s and 1930s when recreational swimming became popular and the 1950s and 1960s when the idea of swimming as a sport really took off.
The first boom was marked by the construction of about 2,000 new municipal pools across the nation.
""Black Americans were largely and systematically denied access to those pools,"" he notes.
""Swimming never became a part of African- American recreational culture.""
In the northern US that segregation in pools ended in the 1940s and early 1950s, but many white swimmers responded by abandoning the municipal pools and heading off to private clubs in the suburbs where segregation continued to be enforced.
""Municipal pools became a low public priority,"" he notes.
After the race riots of the 1960s, many cities did start building pools in predominantly black areas, says Prof Wiltse, but there was still a problem. Many of the new pools were small - often only 20 by 40ft (six by 12m) and 3.5ft (1m) deep.
""They didn't really accommodate swimming. They attracted young kids who would stand in them and splash about. There really wasn't an effort to teach African-American children to swim in these pools.""
Although there are many poor or working class white children who cannot swim for similar reasons, swimming has gained an image as a ""white sport"".
""It is [seen as] a country club sport that only very rich kids get to participate in. The swimming pool is [seen as] a very elitist thing to have in your backyard,"" says Prof Irwin.
Bishop Larry Brandon, of the Praise Temple Full Gospel Baptist Cathedral, knew the Warner family, and is now persuading other pastors and ministers to use their pulpits to promote swimming.
Shreveport has quickly established a new swimming programme in the victims names and there is a drive to challenge misconceptions about swimming.
As well as the fear factor, Prof Irwin's study found that appearance was also a reason for African-Americans avoiding swimming.
Black respondents, far more than white or Hispanic respondents, were sometimes concerned about the effect chlorinated water would have on their hair.
""African-American women, many of them if they go the beauty shop and get their hair fixed they are not going to swim,"" says Bishop Brandon.
Perhaps the most alarming thing is that the studies suggest that those who cannot swim - like the Warners and Stewarts - often spend time in pools and other swimming sites.
""Kids are going to be by the water, they love being by the water, and that's something that we really need to make a priority,"" says Jones.
""Here everybody knows how to drive a car. It should also be a rite of passage to learn how to swim.""","When 15-year-old DeKendrix Warner accidentally stepped into deeper water while wading in the Red River in Shreveport, he panicked. JaTavious Warner, 17, Takeitha Warner, 13, JaMarcus Warner, 14, Litrelle Stewart, 16, and DeAundre Warner, 15, immediately sprang into action. They formed a human chain, each holding onto the person in front of them, and slowly made their way towards DeKendrix, who was struggling to stay afloat.

As DeKendrix began to tire, JaTavious shouted words of encouragement, reminding him to stay calm and keep fighting. Takeitha, the smallest of the group, swam with all her might to reach DeKendrix and provide him with additional support.

With their combined strength and determination, the Warner siblings managed to reach DeKendrix and pull him back to safety. Once they were all back on solid ground, they hugged each other tightly, relieved that everyone was unharmed.

The heroic act of the Warner siblings didn't go unnoticed. Their bravery and quick thinking were celebrated throughout the community, and they were praised for their selflessness and love for one another.

The incident also served as a reminder of the importance of water safety and the need for swimmers to be aware of their surroundings. The Warner siblings hoped that their story would inspire others to take precautions while enjoying water activities and to always look out for one another in times of danger.

From that day forward, the bond between the Warner siblings grew even stronger. They realized that together, they could overcome any obstacle and that their unity was their greatest strength."
"A couple and a baby were rescued and taken to hospital on Saturday but hopes of finding more survivors are fading.
The bodies of fifteen people have so far been recovered, but many more are feared trapped beneath the rubble.
Thousands of rescuers were deployed after some 40 homes were destroyed in Xinmo village in Maoxian county.
Emergency workers have been digging through earth and rocks for a second day, with rescue dogs scouring the debris for some 118 people who remain unaccounted for.
One of those rescued, Qiao Dashuai, told state broadcaster CCTV that his baby had woken him and his partner in the early hours, adding that when the couple opened the door of their home they were swept away by water. He said his parents and other relatives were still missing.
Heavy rain is thought to have triggered the landslide, causing the top section of a mountain to loosen, sending boulders and rocks crashing down onto the village below at about 06:00 local time on Saturday (22:00 GMT on Friday).
Chinese President Xi Jinping later urged the emergency services to ""spare no effort"".
More than 3,000 rescuers have been working in the area, using ropes to move large rocks in the frantic search for villagers.
But geological experts at the site on Sunday said that the chance of finding survivors was becoming ""really slim"", China's Xinhua news agency reports.
The landslide blocked a 2km (1.2-mile) stretch of a river, the news agency added. Local police said a lack of vegetation in the area had made the landslide worse.
Local officials said some 8m cubic metres (282m cubic ft) of rock had been dislodged and roads had been closed to all traffic except emergency services.
Landslides are a regular danger in mountainous regions of China, especially during heavy rains.
In 2008, 87,000 people were killed when an earthquake struck Wenchuan county in Sichuan province. In Maoxian county itself, 37 tourists were killed when their coach was buried in a landslide caused by the 2008 earthquake.",A couple and a baby were rescued and taken to hospital on Saturday but hopes of finding more survivors are fading. The bodies of fifteen people have so far been recovered from the wreckage.

"Agreed sales rose throughout Scotland in September, with 32% more chartered surveyors reporting an increase.
Scotland posted one of the sharpest rises in activity in the UK last month as the British market saw sales growth hit a 16-month high.
The report was compiled by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Its latest UK residential market survey suggested the stronger sales trend was broadly reflective of an upturn in demand, which has been visible in the Scottish market for much of the year.
The number of new buyer inquiries rose in September, with 23% more chartered surveyors reporting a rise in demand.
In addition to activity picking up, September also saw a net balance of 16% more respondents in Scotland reporting an increase in properties being put on the market.
However, the survey indicated supply was still falling behind demand and Scottish house prices continued to rise.
Sarah Speirs, director of Rics in Scotland, said: ""Activity is now picking up which is encouraging and we are seeing slight improvements in stock coming on to the market, although this is still falling short of demand.
""Against this backdrop, we expect prices to move higher over the coming months.""","Agreed sales rose throughout Scotland in September, with 32% more chartered surveyors reporting an increase. Scotland posted one of the sharpest rises in activity in the UK last month as buyers rushed to take advantage of the temporary cut to stamp duty. The reduction, which applies to homes valued up to £250,000 ($330,000), has boosted the housing market across the country.

According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), a net balance of +32% of surveyors in Scotland reported an increase in agreed sales in September. This indicates a substantial improvement in activity compared to the previous month when only +7% reported a rise in sales.

The rise in sales activity in Scotland was higher than the UK average, where a net balance of +17% of surveyors reported an increase in sales. This suggests that the impact of the stamp duty cut was particularly pronounced in Scotland.

The increase in sales was also reflected in higher buyer demand in Scotland. The RICS survey showed that a net balance of +42% of surveyors reported an increase in new buyer enquiries, up from +35% in August.

However, despite the surge in sales"

"The two vehicles burst into flames after the accident in the city of Yanan in the middle of the night, Xinhua news agency reports.
It quoted local police as saying that three people survived the collision, but suffered injuries.
The cause of the accident in Shaanxi province is being investigated.
The two vehicles collided at about 02:00 local time (18:00 GMT Saturday) on the Baotou-Maoming motorway.
""Soon after the collision, the bus was engulfed by flames,"" local police officer Yue Jiuxiang told the state-broadcaster CCTV.
""The front part of the bus was seriously damaged. Also most of the passengers were sleeping. This is why so many people died.""
Chinese media later published photos, showing the burnt wreckage of the bus stuck against the back of the tanker.
Officials said the bus had been heading to Shaanxi's provincial capital of Xian from Inner Mongolia.
China's roads are highly dangerous, with traffic laws and safety widely flouted across the vast country.
In 2011, more than 62,000 died in traffic accidents, state media reported.","The two vehicles burst into flames after the accident in the city of Yanan in the middle of the night, Xinhua news agency reports. It quoted local police as saying that the accident occurred when one vehicle failed to stop at an intersection and collided with another vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to catch fire immediately. 

According to witnesses at the scene, the flames quickly engulfed the vehicles, making it difficult for anyone to approach and render assistance. The fire department was immediately called to the scene and managed to extinguish the flames after several intense minutes.

Unfortunately, the drivers of both vehicles did not survive the accident. Their identities have not been released pending notification of their families.

Authorities are currently investigating the cause of the accident and whether any factors, such as speeding or drunk driving, contributed to the collision. Preliminary reports suggest that poor visibility due to foggy weather conditions may have played a role.

Local residents have expressed their shock and grief over the incident, emphasizing the importance of cautious driving and adhering to traffic regulations. The accident serves as a tragic reminder of the potential dangers on the roads and the need for constant vigil"
"The evaluation by the King's Fund think tank says the coalition government's changes had wasted three years, failed patients, caused financial distress and left a strategic vacuum.
Labour has called for a personal apology from David Cameron.
But Labour itself is accused of ""crying wolf"" over privatisation.
The government said the report showed its plans for the future were right.
The behind-the-scenes changes may not have been immediately apparent to patients in GP surgeries.
But they were described by NHS leaders as ""so big you could see them from space"".
The changes, which came into force in 2013, abolished large numbers of NHS organisations.
The aim was to shift the balance of power in the NHS to give GPs more say over the way budgets were spent.
It provoked uproar in sections of the medical profession, in part over the role of potential privatisation of some services.
King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham told the BBC: ""People in the NHS focused on rearranging the deckchairs rather than the core business of improving patient care.
""That's contributed to the increasing waiting times and declining performance that patients are experiencing.""
He described the reforms as simply ""disastrous"" and said that only in the past two years had the government got its focus right.
However Andrew Lansley, who was the health secretary behind the changes, said patient care had been improved, and patients ""will continue to see the results"" of the reforms.
During the reorganisation, all 151 primary care trusts - which provided services such as hospitals, dentists and opticians - and the 10 regional strategic health authorities were abolished.
New bodies called clinical commissioning groups were set up locally.
The report says: ""A set of policies designed to streamline and simplify the organisation of the NHS ended up having the opposite effect.""
It adds that the system is ""bewildering in its complexity"" and has left a ""strategic vacuum"" in some areas.
The King's Fund says that in the past two years, the focus has rightly shifted to improving patient safety and quality of care as well as treating more people at home rather than in hospital.
In a warning ahead of the election campaign the report said: ""If there is one clear message from the experience of the past five years, it is that politicians of all parties should be wary of ever again embarking on top-down restructuring of the NHS.""
There was also criticism of Labour, who, the King's Fund says, is ""crying wolf"" with ""ill-founded"" claims about the NHS being privatised.
Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ""So now we know that every time patients wait longer for their test results, longer in A&E, longer to get an operation, the responsibility goes direct to David Cameron's door.
""And today he should personally apologise to the British people for having betrayed their trust, let them down and damaged our National Health Service.""
A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""We welcome the King's Fund's recognition that the government's focus on patient safety and integrated care is right for the NHS's future.
""This independent assessment also puts paid to Ed Miliband's myth that the reforms were about privatisation, and highlights why both the public and the health sector should be wary of Labour's plans for upheaval and reorganisation.""
Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association (BMA) said the changes were ""opposed by patients, the public and NHS staff, but politicians pushed through the changes regardless"".
He added: ""This report highlights the damage that has been done to the health service and the major shortcomings of the Act, which distracted attention from rising pressure on services and cost billions to introduce.
""The damage done to the NHS has been profound and intense, but what is needed now is an honest and frank debate over how we can put right what has gone wrong without the need for another unnecessary and costly top-down reorganisation.""
But Mr Lansley said: ""The report is silent on the question of whether patient care has been improved, on which the evidence is clear.
""The NHS is now judged to be the best health service in the world. The number of administrators has fallen, doctors and nurses have risen, productivity has gone up, and waste has been cut by over Â£5bn a year.
""Public sector reform has never been a popularity contest, but these reforms will last.""","The evaluation by the King's Fund think tank says the coalition government's changes had wasted three years, failed patients, caused financial distress and left a strategic vacuum. Labour has called for a full inquiry into the coalition government's healthcare reforms and for the current government to take immediate action to address the problems identified in the evaluation. The Labour Party argues that the findings are evidence of the negative impact of the government's policies on the National Health Service (NHS) and the need for urgent intervention.

The King's Fund evaluation highlights several key issues, including a lack of coherent strategy and leadership, which has led to a fragmentation of the healthcare system. The report also criticizes the implementation of controversial reforms, such as the Health and Social Care Act of 2012, which it argues has hindered the ability of healthcare providers to work together effectively.

Additionally, the evaluation points to financial strains on the NHS, with increasing deficits and inadequate funding, leading to decreased service quality and longer waiting times for patients. It also criticizes the government's handling of workforce planning, resulting in a shortage of healthcare professionals and putting further strain on healthcare services.

Labour has expressed frustration with the coalition government's handling of healthcare reforms and argues that the current government must act swiftly to remedy the situation. They call for an inquiry to examine the impact of the reforms and ensure that mistakes are not repeated.

The coalition government has defended its record, stating that it introduced important reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the NHS. They argue that some of the issues highlighted in the evaluation are systemic challenges faced by the healthcare system, rather than solely the result of government policies.

The evaluation by the King's Fund think tank highlights the ongoing debate surrounding healthcare reforms in the UK and underscores the need for comprehensive and effective policies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the NHS."

His recent injury concerns have only heightened worries about his ability to stay fit and contribute to the team.

Mr Goldsmith won 28,588 votes, with Ms Olney receiving 28,543 votes on a turnout of 79%.
Mr Goldsmith admitted he had won by a ""narrow margin"" but thanked the voters of Richmond Park for giving him another chance to represent them.
''I hope my constituents know I will never let them down. "" he added.
Ms Olney took the seat from Mr Goldsmith, who stood as an independent after his temporary departure from the Tories, last year.

"David McNally's Twitter account said he had left following his club's defeat against Manchester United. The tweet was later deleted and the club did not comment.
Norwich City Football Club confirmed on Monday that McNally had resigned.
""Everyone at Carrow Road wishes him all the very best for the future,"" it said.
McNally resignation: 'Norwich City top brass under increasing scrutiny'
The statement on the club's website said: ""The board of directors had unanimously agreed to accept McNally's resignation and would like to place on record their sincere gratitude for David's game-changing contribution to the football club since he joined in the summer of 2009.
""David played a leading role as the club erased crippling debts and rose from the lower reaches of League One to the Barclays Premier League.
""Director of finance Steve Stone has been appointed interim chief executive and the board and everybody at the club is totally focused on supporting Alex and the players, as we head in to Wednesday night's vital Premier League game against Watford at Carrow Road.""
On Saturday, McNally replied to a fan on Twitter who called on him to leave the club after the defeat by Manchester United.
The fan blamed a lack of investment for the Canaries current plight - facing relegation from the lucrative Premier League.
In a tweet, he said: ""I understand your view. I've resigned tonight and I hope the club can now progress.""
David McNally's departure is a hugely significant moment for Norwich City. This was the man who ran the club on a day-to-day basis and had the final say on most things, from player transfers to what was on sale in the club shop.
He arrived in 2009 with the club at its lowest point in 50 years following relegation to League One.
He oversaw successive promotions, four of the past five seasons in the Premier League and the club clearing all external debt - all of which will count in his favour in the eyes of Norwich City supporters.
But with the prospect of a second relegation from the top flight in three seasons looming, the club's top brass was coming under increasing scrutiny.
Then, hours later, Mr McNally seemingly retracted his resignation, insisting he remains fully committed to the club.
The tweet said: ""I take back what was said earlier. I remain fully committed to NCFC and to Delia and Michael and I've not resigned. My apologies.""
Both tweets were then deleted.
The Canaries' current predicament sees the club four points from safety with two games to play. On Wednesday, they face Watford at home and then Everton away on the last day of the season.
Both Newcastle United and Norwich City will be relegated to the Championship if Sunderland win on Wednesday.
A strong ally of co-owner Delia Smith, Mr McNally arrived at Carrow Road in 2009 from Fulham having previously spent four years as sales and marketing director at Celtic.
Norwich City fans on Twitter have praised McNally and thanked him for his work at the club, while others have questioned the timing of his departure.
MrTomParsley said: ""The loss of @davidmcnally62  just made the inevitable relegation a lot more worrying, he deserves only respect & thanks from all #ncfc fans.""
Dan Brigham of the Little Yellow Bird Project, which produces podcasts on Norwich City, told BBC Radio Norfolk: ""I interviewed him earlier this year and he said he wanted to leave a legacy, leave Norwich City with a 35,000-capacity stadium, and a first class training facility.
""He will see this [Norwich City facing relegation] as a real failure, as not part of the plan.
""We're not relegated yet, so the timing is weird.""",David McNally's Twitter account said he had left following his club's defeat against Manchester United. The tweet was later deleted and the club did not comment. Norwich City Football Club has not released an official statement regarding David McNally's departure.

"The Old Trafford outfit, who are unbeaten in the Championship all season, have secured an immediate return to the top tier with two games left to play. They need just 12 more points to be crowned champions.
Mark Chilton was the last Red Rose captain to achieve promotion back in 2005 and was also part of their Championship-winning side of 2011.
The 36-year-old assesses the key factors to Lancashire securing a return to the top flight.
Relegation came as a surprise for Lancashire in 2012, less than 12 months after they had been crowned outright champions for the first time in 77 years. The only goal for 2013 was promotion.
""The challenge for that season when you're in Division Two is that it almost feels like you're not playing for anything major. It's just a case of 'we've got to get ourselves back in that top division'.
""I remember 2005 being a bit of a stop-gap season and I'm pretty sure the lads will have felt like that this year.
""It hasn't surprised me that they've been so dominant. If you had spoken to me in April, I'd have confidently said they would have been going up, more than likely as champions.
""Clearly, in four-day cricket, they've really played very well this year. There's lots of good things happening at the club, with lots of good people involved, and over time, more often than not it will produce good results.""
Six of Lancashire's eight home Championship fixtures in 2013 have been played at Old Trafford, compared with just two in 2012, following the completion of a multi-million pound redevelopment at the county's traditional home.
""I do think it's made a significant difference.
""Liverpool became a bit of a fortress for us in 2011 but having the home comforts of the new stadium, which is a fantastic facility and a lovely place to be, has probably really helped to settle the side.
""They've started to create the same feeling that we had at Liverpool in 2011, in that it becomes a difficult place to play.
""There would have been a lot of people holding their breath this summer. It was a big moment for the club because an awful lot of work had been done to get to that stage.
""To see the ground full for a Test match and a one-day international match [both against Australia] is what a lot of people have worked hard towards. They can sit back and take a great deal of satisfaction from a job well done.""
With 122 Test appearances between them for South Africa and Australia respectively, Ashwell Prince and Simon Katich have brought some much-needed experience to Lancashire's batting line-up and are their top two run scorers in four-day cricket.
""Simon is probably  The times I've seen him, he's looked very fluent and has scored a great volume of runs.
""I got the chance to play with Ashwell and I know what a determined performer he is.
""You're always guaranteed runs with those two guys. You'll very rarely put them into a situation that they've not played out before, so they can play lots of different roles and also complement the other guys in the team.""
The evergreen Glen Chapple and the rejuvenated Kyle Hogg have both taken more than 50 first-class wickets for Lancashire in 2013, their stand-out performance coming in June when they dismissed Essex for just 20.
""After starting with successive home draws, Lancashire's campaign burst into life with a dramatic win against Glamorgan at Colwyn Bay, bowling the home side out for 139.
""Two victories against Essex, the first coming after chasing down 253 to win on the final day at Old Trafford, and then bowling Essex out for just 20 at Chelmsford, were remarkable achievements and big highlights.
""Once they picked up their first win, they never really looked back. With a trio of bowlers claiming more than 50 wickets apiece and runs coming from throughout the team, Lancashire are worthy of promotion in 2013.""
""I've known Glen a long time and he looks as fit as I've seen him for a long time. The important thing for him is to keep his body in a good shape so that he can go out and demonstrate those skills.
""If you ask the majority of opening batsmen their top three hardest opponents, he will be in most people's top three. He's very well respected and
""The partnership between Glen and Kyle was a real strength in 2011, and
""Similarly to finding a good opening partnership with the bat, exactly the same thing applies with the ball.
""Where they're very strong is that they don't give much to hit. They're always testing techniques early on, always asking questions and not leaking too many runs so they're putting sides under pressure straight away.
""They obviously enjoy bowling with each other and it's proved to be an effective partnership this year.""
Gary Keedy had been Lancashire's front-line spinner for much of his 18 years with the county, but his pre-season departure to Surrey has allowed Simon Kerrigan to flourish in a season that ended with him being handed a Test debut by England.
""Simon has always been an exciting cricketer - an aggressive spin bowler who is always looking to take wickets.
""His  will have been up and down, but they will stand him in good stead.
""I really think he will go on to be a high-class international spinner. He's got all the attributes. When he's bowling well, he bowls people out and he wins games.""
Lancashire have offered first-team chances to talented youngsters in recent seasons and 2013 has been no different, with opener Luis Reece, 23, making the most significant breakthrough.
""Luis was involved during my time and he forced his way in through the sheer volume of runs he was scoring in every form of cricket he was playing. It's very hard to ignore that.
""He's got his game organised and he's shown himself to be a consistent performer.
""I've done it myself - if you can bat a long time, see off the new ball and bat out that first session, you're setting a platform for the team to get big runs.

"Johnson won the men's downhill event at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo.
An attempted comeback at the age of 40 ended when he suffered a traumatic brain injury when he crashed during a training run in March 2001.
Johnson had been living in a care home in Gresham, Oregon, since suffering a major stroke in 2010.
The Los Angeles-born skier, who grew up in Oregon, came to prominence when he became the first male American skier to win a World Cup downhill race, in Wengen, Switzerland in January 1984, before predicting he would follow it up with an Olympic gold - which he did.
However, he subsequently fell out with US skiing officials. He had financial support withdrawn after turning up three days late for a training camp in 1985, and was suspended in 1988 for disciplinary reasons, failing to make the Winter Olympics team that year.
His attempt at a comeback in time for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City ended with a crash at Montana's Big Mountain resort. He barely survived, suffering critical injuries, and spent three weeks in a coma.",Johnson won the men's downhill event at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. An attempted comeback at the age of 40 ended when he suffered a traumatic brain injury when he crashed during a training run.
"His was not the only voice warning of the dangers of AI - Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak also expressed their concerns about where the technology was heading - though Professor Hawking's was the most apocalyptic vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us any more.
What all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate.
That they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI.
And Professor Hawking was there to help launch the centre. ""I'm glad someone was listening,"" he told the audience.
In a short speech, he outlined the potential and the pitfalls of the technology in his usual vivid language.  He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances.
""I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it.""
That, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity.
""In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which.""
So, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.
Actually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.
Long before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.
Another speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.
She told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.
Her concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. ""I'm scared of that,"" she said.
After decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.
Just one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.

These prominent figures in the tech industry have been vocal about their apprehensions regarding the development of artificial intelligence.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has repeatedly stated that AI poses an existential threat to humanity. He believes that if left unchecked, AI could surpass human intelligence and become uncontrollable. Musk has called for regulation and oversight to ensure the safe and responsible development of AI.

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, has expressed similar concerns. He has emphasized the need for proper governance and ethics in AI development to avoid unforeseen consequences. Gates has also highlighted the importance of focusing on the benefits of AI while addressing its potential risks.

Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, has raised concerns about AI taking over human jobs and potentially leading to economic inequality. He believes that humans should remain in control of AI systems and that they should always serve and benefit humanity.

These influential figures have used their platforms to bring attention to the potential dangers of AI and the importance of responsible development. Their voices have contributed to a growing discussion surrounding AI ethics and the need for collaborative efforts to mitigate risks and ensure a safe future with artificial intelligence."
"The Welsh Labour leader said an extra £20m would be provided for social care ""to ease the burden on the NHS"".
Mr Jones also announced free Wifi on Welsh trains and at stations, and free long distance bus services at weekends.
Before he spoke, in Llandudno, UK leader Jeremy Corbyn urged delegates not to be afraid of a accumulating debt to improve lives.
In his conference speech Mr Jones praised the ""tenacious and dignified campaign"" being fought by Labour Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris on funeral costs for children.
""Today I am pleased to confirm that the welsh Labour Government will step in, and make sure that burial charges for children will no longer apply in Welsh communities,"" he said.
The policy is expected to cost £750,000 to £1m per year.
He also announced £20m extra ""for social care to ease the burden on the NHS, to ensure dignity for older and vulnerable people and to give the staff the resources they need"".
Mr Jones said the Welsh Government ""will ensure that every train on the Wales and Borders franchise will be equipped with free Wi-fi by September this year"".
50 of Wales' busiest stations in Wales will also gain free internet access, and Mr Jones announced a ""12 month pilot of free weekend travel on our long distance TrawsCymru service to encourage more people to travel on the network"".
Mr Jones told the conference hall at Venue Cymru that everything that has happened since last May's assembly elections ""merely underlines the strength"" of the party's result at that poll.
Labour held 29 seats, losing one but remaining the largest party in the assembly.
Mr Jones said the party's loss in Gower in the 2015 general election ""changed the way we approached"" the May 2016 poll.
He said the Welsh Government had to make a ""success"" of the Brexit process. ""I firmly believe we have to get real about this - Brexit is happening.""
Mr Jones accused Theresa May's UK government of having ""no ideas, no direction, no mandate"", and claimed that it was Welsh Labour ""that delivered a future for steel, when the Tories did nothing.""
During his speech, Mr Jones announced the establishment of a ""fair work commission"" with Wales TUC and business groups.
Mr Jones said: ""I made no apology for putting jobs and growth at the heart of successive budgets in the last assembly.
""Unemployment in Wales now stands at 4.4% - lower than the UK average. I want to make Wales a fair work nation where everyone can access better jobs closer to home.""
A vote to formally give Mr Jones the title of Welsh Labour leader, rather than leader of the party's group of AMs in Cardiff Bay, that was due to take place on Saturday will now be held at conference on Sunday.
It follows a problem with conference delegates' voting cards.
On Friday the first minister Carwyn Jones warned his party would find it tough to avoid losses in May's local elections, having performed well in 2012.

There were no shortages of jokes, historical references and old-fashioned Tory-bashing from Carwyn Jones in Llandudno.
He had some extra money to play with thanks to Philip Hammond's budget.
Carwyn Jones also made some big claims which deserve a closer look.
In a bullish section on the NHS, he said waiting times were going down - in some areas this may be the case but there has been no broad-based substantial reduction in waits.

"Northern Ireland's McIlroy, twice a winner in seven US PGA starts, bogeyed the last for a one-under 69 to finish three over and miss the cut by one.
American Walker also bogeyed the 18th for a 66 and nine-under total, matched by Streb who birdied his last for 63.
Defending champion Jason Day had eight birdies in a 65 to get to seven under.
The Australian world number one is tied third with Argentina's Emiliano Grillo (67), while Open winner Henrik Stenson of Sweden is one shot back after carding a second three-under 67 to move to six under.
Germany's Martin Kaymer (69), who won this tournament in 2010, and Americans Patrick Reed (65) and Brooks Koepka (67) are four adrift on five under.
Wales' Jamie Donaldson (67) is the highest-placed Briton at the final major of the season on four under, one ahead of world number three Jordan Spieth, who also shot 67.
With the cut mark hovering between one and two over par, McIlroy, who holed a 30-foot putt on the 17th to get to two over, thought he needed another birdie on the last.
The four-time major winner hit his second on the par-five 18th into greenside rough and took three more shots to get on the green before holing out for a bogey.
""I thought I needed to make four, so that's what I was trying to do,"" said the 2012 and 2014 US PGA champion.
""It was a tough lie. I hit the first one as hard as I really could considering how close the pin was to the edge of the green.""
The world number four went straight to the practice green after taking 35 putts in round one but he said his efforts on Friday, when he took 30, were ""pathetic"".
""Putting let me down at [the US Open in June at] Oakmont and then putting let me down here again,"" he said.
""My tee to green game - there's not much wrong with that. It's pretty solid. If you had given anyone else in this field my tee shots this week, they would have been up near the top of the leaderboard.
""It just shows you how bad I was around the greens.""
The Swede was grouped with the year's other two major winners - Masters champion Danny Willett and US Open victor Dustin Johnson - and he outscored them on both days.
He dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field.
""I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18,"" said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago.
""That could easily have gone the wrong way but I was hanging in there and got the good stuff coming in.""
Willett birdied the ninth to card a 70 and make the cut on one over, but pre-tournament favourite Johnson is going home after adding a 72 to his opening 77 for a nine-over total.
Neither American has never won a major and while Walker has five victories on the PGA Tour, Streb has just one and has missed nine cuts in 23 events in 2016.
Walker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th.
He pulled his tee shot on the 17th into a hospitality area and escaped with a free drop and par five but an almost identical shot on the last was not so lucky, ending up in a lake and resulting in a dropped shot.
""The finish wasn't what I was looking for, but it's fine,"" said Walker. ""I think you take 66 at any tournament all day every day. So it's good.
""I will watch the leaderboard on Saturday. I don't think that's a big deal. I enjoy watching it. I think you need to know where you are at.""
Streb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62.
The 29-year-old, who missed the cut at each of the first three majors of 2016, said he turned up this week ""just to see if I could play some good golf and have fun"".
He added: ""Obviously it's going pretty well, but my expectations are pretty low, which maybe is a good thing.""
Day was Friday's other big mover, knocking in seven birdies in eight holes from the eighth to sit two off the lead.
""I kind of gave myself a little bit of a kick up the bum with the double bogey on seven,"" he said.
""It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine.""
Former world number one and two-time major winner Spieth had five birdies in his opening nine holes to get to four under par but missed several opportunities to better his score on his back nine, while a bogey saw him close on three under.
""It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention,"" said the American. ""I'm hitting the ball fantastic. I just can't get a putt to go in from beyond 10 feet.""
Kaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under.
""I made a few putts here and there. I enjoyed the last few holes,"" he said. ""It was important for me to finish the way I did.""
Andrew Johnston continued to impress in the majors, after finishing tied for eighth at The Open, with a one-under-par 69 to reach halfway at one under.
The Englishman, better known by his nickname 'Beef', started on the 10th and was two under after nine holes. He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth.
""Every hole, man, I get so many nice comments,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Even after the fifth hole, when I three-putted, they are like, 'Don't worry, Beef, come on, bounce back, you've got this one'. And it's just nice, man. It's a nice atmosphere.""
Lee Westwood (70) hit 92% of greens in regulation as he also finished on one under, alongside fellow Englishmen Ross Fisher (73) and Tyrrell Hatton (68).
Andy Sullivan, who reached five under, dropped away with six bogeys in nine holes through the middle of his round before finishing birdie-eagle on the two par-five finishing holes to post a 71 and a two-under total that matched Paul Casey (69).
Scotland's Russell Knox is also playing the weekend after a second 70 left him level par, along with Wales' Bradley Dredge.
English pair Matthew Fitzpatrick (70) and Justin Rose (72) beat the cut by one shot.","Northern Ireland's McIlroy, twice a winner in seven US PGA starts, bogeyed the last for a one-under 69 to finish three over and miss the cut by one.

"Figures from Police Scotland show that the overall level of crime has fallen by 10%
Despite this fall, there were rises in the number of sexual crimes and rapes reported.
Reports of violent crime and anti-social behaviour also fell over the past year.
Police Scotland said the rise in reported rapes and sexual crimes did not necessarily mean more of these types of crimes were being committed, but that people were becoming more confident at speaking out.
In the first full year of Scotland's single police force the number of alleged rapes being reported to the authorities increased by more than a fifth to almost 1,700 while the level of sexual crimes recorded rose by 11.8%.
A quarter of all sexual crime reported to police was historic and almost a quarter of rape victims were under 15 years of age at the time the crime was alleged to have happened.
Det Supt Louise Raphael, lead officer for the National Rape Task Force, said: ""Our assessment is that people are becoming more confident in speaking out, often regarding incidents which happened some time prior to contact being made with the police or other organisations.
""Changes to the legal definition of rape, the way we work with partners and improvements in the way we now investigate these crimes has influenced the number and type of cases we are seeing.""
The data also showed that police had become more efficient in investigating these crimes with more than 75% of these cases being detected by officers.
Scotland's Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said: ""The data clearly shows rises in sexual crime including the number of rape cases reported to us and investigated.
""We said from the outset of the single service that such crimes were under-reported and that we wanted to instil confidence in those who suffer at the hands of sexual offenders or domestic abusers.
""Police Scotland will continue to work strongly with partners to provide a united approach to addressing the issue of rape and domestic abuse.""
He added: ""We must tackle the offenders to reduce the number of victims we see day in, day out coming to us to report some horrendous crimes.
""These are crimes which occur across Scotland, in every community, with victims and offenders from all backgrounds. ""
The statistics also showed that while the number of domestic abuse incidents fell by 1.8% to 58,976, the proportion of these resulting in a crime report rose to 57.6%.
Violent crime, including assault, robbery and attempted murder decreased by a total of 10%, although the number of murders remained the same as the previous year at 56.
Domestic abuse also continued to make up almost a quarter of violent crime recorded with one in four common assaults related to domestic abuse.
The amount of anti-social behaviour, vandalism and disorder also fell over the past 12 months.
The figures also showed that there were fewer road collisions and fewer people injured on Scotland's road network.
However, there was an increase in the number of people killed in collisions, with 191 people killed, an increase of 24 from the previous year.
The report also showed that efforts to tackle to tackle organised crime in Scotland had resulted in 2,677 arrests linked to serious organised crime with the Proceeds of Crime Act recoveries totalling Â£82m in cash and restraints.
Sir Stephen House concluded: ""The publication of our management information today provides a 12 month profile of crime, offences and incidents across the country.
""Regardless of where or when a crime has taken place Police Scotland is committed to keeping people safe and will continue with every effort to provide routes for victims to come forward and ensure there are no hiding places for offenders.""","Figures from Police Scotland show that the overall level of crime has fallen by 10% Despite this fall, there were rises in the number of sexual crimes and rapes reported. According to figures from Police Scotland, the overall level of crime has decreased by 10%. This indicates a positive trend in reducing criminal activities in the region. However, the data also reveals an increase in the number of sexual crimes and rapes reported.

While the decrease in overall crime is promising, the rise in sexual crimes and rapes is a concerning development. It highlights the need for further attention and measures to address and combat these specific forms of criminality.

It is important to consider potential reasons behind the reported increase in sexual crimes and rapes. Factors such as increased reporting, awareness campaigns, improved victim support, and changes in societal attitudes towards reporting such crimes might contribute to these higher figures. It could also indicate an actual increase in incidents, which would require focused efforts to identify and address the root causes.

Addressing sexual crimes and rapes necessitates a comprehensive approach involving law enforcement agencies, community organizations, and policymakers. This approach should focus on prevention, education, awareness, and support services for both victims and potential offenders.

Furthermore, it is crucial for the authorities to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of these crimes. Specialized training for police officers, dedicated resources for specialized units, and close collaboration with other agencies and organizations could contribute to improved responses to sexual crimes and rapes.

Overall, the rise in reported sexual crimes and rapes amidst a decrease in overall crime levels indicates an area that requires increased attention and effective intervention. It is important to acknowledge the issue, work towards understanding the underlying causes, and implement comprehensive strategies to prevent and address sexual crimes and rapes in the community."
"The only problem? It wasn't true. Only two of the 10 were found guilty. Was it a calculated leak? Or did officials simply neglect to correct an error that made good PR?
The trial was held inside Paitham, where an anti-terrorism court was convened in a former hotel building converted into a military detention centre.
Surprisingly no one, including local journalists, had any inkling previously that a trial had been in progress.
An army spokesman told journalists he would be issuing a statement, but later changed his mind. A public prosecutor told the Associated Press news agency that 10 men had been sentenced to life, but later denied ever speaking to the reporter.
Amid all the confusion though, one thing was clear: Pakistan had been under pressure to get convictions, and suddenly it appeared to have 10.
Over the past one year or so, Pakistan has been trying to reposition itself against the militants it has been frequently accused of supporting, a charge it denies.
In June 2014, the army launched a ground operation in North Waziristan, targeting the sanctuaries of militants who were becoming increasingly hostile towards Pakistan.
At the same time, the Pakistani military launched what many called ""a diplomatic offensive"", which took army chief Gen Raheel Sharif on high profile trips to Kabul, Washington and London.
His globe-trotting was seen by many as an attempt to reset Pakistan's mostly troubled relations with Afghanistan and the US and to pre-empt a possible flow of militants from Afghanistan into Pakistan after Nato's departure from the region.
The Taliban attack on the Army Public Public School in Peshawar in December underlined the group's aversion to education - the reason why they shot Malala Yousafzai in the first place.
Ms Yousafzai had received the Nobel Peace Prize just a week before the massacre. Her image as an emerging international celebrity drew attention to Pakistan's failure to arrest the culprits.
Then in September, army spokesman Major-General Asim Bajwa made a triumphant announcement that 10 men had been arrested in connection with the attacks.
No details were given about the alleged attackers, except the charge that they were affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) and had more than 20 other social and political activists on their hit list.
Major-General Bajwa did not say when and where the men had been arrested or how they were linked to the attack on Ms Yousafzai.
Furthermore, the list of men arrested did not include the names of those the civilian authorities had earlier identified as Ms Yousafzai's attackers.
The shroud of secrecy around the trial and convictions has raised serious doubts over whether these men were really who the authorities said they were, and whether they did what the authorities say they did.
Now, with the revelation that we were in the dark even about how many people had been convicted, those doubts are not likely to fade away.","The only problem? It wasn't true. Only two of the 10 were found guilty. Was it a calculated leak? Or did officials simply neglect to correct an error that made it appear all 10 were guilty? Regardless, the misinformation spread like wildfire, tarnishing the reputations of the eight individuals who were innocent. The damage caused by this false narrative is immense, with their names now permanently associated with a crime they did not commit.

This situation raises several important questions. Why did it take so long for the truth to come out? Did the authorities conduct a thorough investigation into the alleged perpetrators in the first place? And most importantly, what impact will this wrongful conviction have on the lives of those who were unjustly implicated?

Additionally, it is essential to examine the role of the media and their responsibility in reporting accurate information. Did they play a role in perpetuating the false narrative, or were they also victims of the initial misinformation?

The aftermath of this incident highlights the need for a fair and impartial justice system, one that prioritizes accurate investigation and holds accountable those responsible for spreading false information. Steps must be taken to rectify the damage done to the innocent individuals affected by this grave error, and ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future."

Fine Gael was founded in 1933 and has traditionally positioned itself as a Christian democratic party. However, in recent years it has moved towards a more liberal and centrist political stance. 

Under Enda Kenny's leadership, Fine Gael implemented a series of austerity measures in response to the economic crisis that hit Ireland in 2008. The party's policies focused on reducing public spending, increasing taxes, and promoting economic growth. Kenny's government also successfully negotiated a bailout with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, helping Ireland regain stability and return to economic growth.

In terms of social issues, Fine Gael has taken a more progressive approach compared to its conservative roots. The party supported the successful 2018 referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, which effectively legalized abortion in Ireland. It has also been a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, with Kenny becoming the first Irish prime minister to openly support same-sex marriage.

The party's main priorities for the future include further economic development, infrastructure investment, and the promotion of a united Ireland. Fine Gael seeks to achieve this through responsible governance, increased support for businesses, and fostering strong relationships with other European Union member states.

However, Fine Gael has faced criticism for its handling of housing and healthcare issues, which remain major concerns for the Irish population. The party has also been challenged by the rise of Sinn Féin, a left-wing nationalist party, in recent years.

Despite these challenges, Fine Gael remains a dominant force in Irish politics and has consistently been one of the"

The five candidates were speaking on a BBC Radio Bristol election debate programme.
The English Democrats' Clive Lavelle, who was not at the debate, said traffic problems were ""part-and-parcel of being an outlying village"".
""Over the years, successive local authorities attempt to upgrade dirt-tracks into metalled roads, then widen them; but there is a limit to how far this process can go,"" he added.
John Monro, Liberal Democrat, said: ""There are a number of villages that surround the constituency that are vitally important.
""One of the most important things is making sure the villages are well connected to the town, to allow people to live and work there - to keep the economy within the constituency.""
John Penrose, Conservative, added: ""I agree about the transport connections. Of course it also means connections into Taunton and Bristol, as well.
""Junction 21 [M5, Weston-super-Mare] is hugely improved but there are further improvements needed on things like our train service.""
UKIP's Ernie Warrender said: ""I'll touch briefly on Banwell. I mean that's an absolute classic.
""There's just been planning permission granted by the current council for 1,107 houses just down the road.
""If you have ever driven through Banwell, you'd be better off walking. It'd be a lot, lot quicker.""
Tim Taylor, Labour, said: ""I understand the concerns about new housing [in rural areas] but the population is aging in those villages.
""They have to attract young families and the only way to do that is by building [affordable] housing. Otherwise some of those communities are going to suffer.
""It's [also] about making sure that only HGVs that go there are delivering to local businesses, because the air quality, particularly in Banwell, is quite poor.""

"The launch of the Soyuz was watched by Mr Putin, who had flown 5,500km (3,500 miles) to the country's Far East for the event.
The Vostochny cosmodrome was built to reduce dependency on the Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan.
The unmanned rocket is carrying three satellites.
It left Earth at 05:01 Moscow time (02:01 GMT).
The initial attempt at launch was called off less than two minutes before lift-off on Wednesday, following a technical fault.
Mr Putin stressed that the delay was related to the rocket itself - not the cosmodrome, located in the Amur region near the Russian-Chinese border.
It was Mr Putin's personal idea to build a new space port in Russia to avoid any potential political risks of using the old Soviet launch centre at Baikonur.
But construction of the vast complex in Russia's Far East has been hit by delays and dogged by corruption scandals.
Four people have already been arrested.

The Vostochny cosmodrome was built to enable Russia to launch its own space crafts and reduce its dependence on the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome began in 2012, and it became operational in 2016.

The Vostochny cosmodrome serves as a modern space launch facility, equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and technology. Its construction was a significant achievement for Russia's space program, as it provides the country with increased independence and control over its space missions.

By launching its space crafts from the Vostochny cosmodrome, Russia can avoid potential geopolitical complications and logistical challenges associated with using the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which it leases from Kazakhstan. Additionally, the Vostochny cosmodrome is strategically located closer to Russia's eastern regions, allowing for more efficient launches and logistical operations.

"Owners of Denbigh's former North Wales Hospital lost a High Court bid on Thursday to overturn Denbighshire council's compulsory purchase order of the Victorian mental asylum.
It has been involved in a long-running row with the owners over its future.
Councillor David Smith said the authority planned to buy the building and transfer it to a trust to renovate.
The hospital closed in 1996 and the site was later bought by Freemont (Denbigh) Ltd.
Permission for housing was secured but work never began.
In 2011 the council, frustrated at the deterioration of the Grade II-listed building, served an urgent works notice on the company and then carried out repair work by default.
But in August last year, Freemont lost an appeal over the council's attempt to recover Â£900,000 it spent on emergency repairs.
The council has agreed to pass ownership of it to the North Wales Building Preservation Trust, a non-profit organisation, which will receive support from the Princes Regeneration Trust.
The authority added the trust hopes to build housing on the site.","Owners of Denbigh's former North Wales Hospital lost a High Court bid on Thursday to overturn Denbighshire council's compulsory purchase order of the Victorian mental asylum. It has been involved in a long-standing legal battle between the council and the owners, who have been accused of neglecting the site. The Denbighshire council issued the compulsory purchase order in 2013 due to concerns over the condition of the dilapidated building and the potential risks it poses to public safety. The former North Wales Hospital was once a major psychiatric hospital but has been abandoned for several decades, leading to its deterioration.

The owners of the site, Freemont (Denbigh) Limited, had challenged the compulsory purchase order in the High Court, arguing that they had made efforts to secure the building and were planning to restore it. However, the judge ruled in favor of the council, stating that the owners had failed to adequately maintain the site and that the order was necessary to protect public safety.

"The cause of his death has not yet been revealed, although his daughter said he had passed away ""peacefully"".
Author of many folk songs in the llanera tradition of the Venezuelan plains, his most famous song is Caballo Viejo (Old Horse).
Known as ""Uncle Simon"", he was widely seen as an ambassador for Venezuelan folkloric music worldwide.
Diaz was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 for his recording career.
From humble origins, he was known for his poetic and lyrical compositions.
While he strayed into other genres such as boleros and tango, most of his work stayed true to the llanera music style of Venezuela, with its characteristic harp and cuatro, a four-stringed instrument similar to the guitar.
His songs have been sung by opera stars such as Placido Domingo and many other Latin American artists such as Mercedes Sosa and Caetano Veloso.
German choreographer Pina Bausch included some of Diaz's music in her work Nur Du.
Diaz became a TV star, presenting a dozen shows featuring the best of Venezuelan folk music.
One of his most popular shows was a children's music programme broadcast in the 1970s and 80s. His nickname of Uncle Simon dates back to this show.
Diaz stopped appearing in public after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, but his daughter Bettsimar recently showcased her father's legacy in the programme All About My Father.","The cause of his death has not yet been revealed, although his daughter said he had passed away ""peacefully"".

"At their spring conference in Dartford, party chairman Robin Tilbrook suggested England should vote for independence.
The country's desire for more conservative government was being thwarted, he said.
In April Mr Tilbrook said that up to one in 10 party members had converted from the British National Party.
Mr Tilbrook founded the English National Party in 1998 and the party - which was renamed in 2002 - achieved its first major success in 2009 when Peter Davies won the Doncaster mayoral election.
But Mr Davies subsequently quit the party over the BNP influx.
The party campaigns for EU exit and the establishment of an English parliament.
Mr Tilbrook criticised the previous Labour government's devolution policy, which he said had ""seriously undermined the English sense of identity"".
""Elections to the Scottish Parliament showed that the Scots had shifted their allegiance from Labour to the SNP, but they still want the English to be governed by the Labour Party,"" he said.
""They vote to place Labour politicians, who they don't particularly want at home, in Westminster.
""The English, who have voted Conservative more often than Labour in all post-war elections have to accept a block vote of Labour members of parliament sent to Westminster by the Scots.
""Should we not vote for our independence given that we risk being governed from a country that already regulates its own affairs and has no clear commitment to ours?""
Ahead of the conference Mr Tilbrook told the BBC that the party was composed of social democrats trying to be the ""voice for English nationalism"".
There was a ""good chance"" that the party would pick up seats at the European Parliament in May's elections, he said.
He also warned: ""We are moving towards what's probably the break-up of the UK.
""This year we've got the Scottish referendum on independence and one of the things that has delighted us is we've had the president of the EU Commission tell us that if Scotland decides to go then that means they're out of the EU.
""So if England decides to go, equally we're out of the EU.""
The party was optimistic about the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, he continued.
""People are feeling much more strongly about being English. If we double our vote there's a good chance we're going to start winning MEP seats.""","At their spring conference in Dartford, party chairman Robin Tilbrook suggested England should vote for independence. The country's desire for more conservative government was being thwarted, he said. In April 2021, Tilbrook argued that England should follow in the footsteps of Scotland and hold a referendum on independence. He claimed that England's interests were being neglected within the United Kingdom and that a separate English government could better address the desires for a more conservative approach to governance.

Tilbrook highlighted that many conservative policies, which were popular among the English population, were not being implemented due to the influence of other parts of the UK. He argued that an independent England would have the freedom to pursue policies that align closely with the desires of its citizens, without being held back by compromises made at the UK level.

Tilbrook's suggestion gained some support within the party, with several members expressing their belief that an independent England would be better equipped to address issues such as immigration, law and order, and national identity.

However, the proposal also faced criticism from those who felt that dividing the UK further would only lead to more fragmentation and weaken the overall strength and influence of the country.

Ultimately, the idea of English independence remains a topic of debate and discussion within the Conservative Party, with differing opinions on whether it would provide a solution to the perceived frustrations of English voters."
"Gayle Newland, 25, demanded the other woman wear a blindfold when they met, and used a prosthetic penis while carrying out the assaults.
Newland, of Willaston, Cheshire, had told a court the pair were engaging in role play and fantasy.
But a Chester Crown Court jury found her guilty of three sexual assault charges.
She was cleared of two other counts of the same charge.
Newland had told jurors the other woman had known she was female, and both of them had been struggling with their sexuality.
She had denied using a blindfold, and said she did not strap bandages to her chest and wear a woollen hat and swimsuit, as the victim had alleged.
But during the four-day trial she did admit to creating a fake Facebook profile in the name Kye Fortune.
The victim told the jury how she met ""Kye"" online in 2011, and the pair struck up a friendship.
Kye initially told her he was not well enough to see her due to being treated for car accident injuries and a brain tumour.
But the pair spoke frequently on the phone, the court heard, and eventually arranged to meet for sex at a hotel on the condition the woman wore a blindfold - because Kye was embarrassed by his scars.
They went on to spend more than 100 hours in each other's company in hotels and the victim's flat, with the assaults taking place between February and June 2013.
The deception was finally uncovered during their final sexual encounter, when the victim removed the blindfold and saw Newland instead of Kye.
She insisted she had always believed Kye had been a man, telling the court: ""In hindsight I wish I had ripped that mask off sooner.""
Adjourning the case for sentencing, Judge Roger Dutton said Newland had ""serious issues surrounding her personality"".
He warned her she may face ""serious consequences"" when she is sentenced in November.
In response, Newland shouted: ""How can you send me down for something I have not done?""
She broke down in tears and repeatedly said ""I don't understand, I don't understand"", after the verdict was returned.
The judge thanked jurors for their ""careful consideration"" of the case and said it would present a ""difficult sentencing exercise"".
Det Insp Clare Coleman, of Cheshire Constabulary, said it was ""important to remember there is a victim at the heart of [the case]"".
""This was a highly elaborate deception where Newland abused the trust that the victim had in her,"" she said.
""She has been extremely upset by what has happened and there is no doubt there will be a lasting psychological impact on her.""
Newland was released on bail prior to sentencing.","Gayle Newland, 25, demanded the other woman wear a blindfold when they met, and used a prosthetic penis while carrying out the assaults.

Newland was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault in 2015 and sentenced to eight years in prison. The case highlighted the importance of consent and the potential for deception in sexual relationships."

"The activist, who had been serving an 11-year prison term for ""subversion"", died in a hospital in China aged 61.
Amid tributes for the late campaigner, the Nobel Committee, which gave him the Peace Prize in 2010, said China bore a ""heavy responsibility"" for his death.
Beijing is now being urged to free his wife, poet Liu Xia, from house arrest.
While official reaction in China has been restrained, one state-run newspaper accused ""Western forces"" of politicising the case.
Mr Liu had been moved from a prison to a hospital in the north-eastern city of Shenyang last month, where he was being kept under heavy security.
The Chinese government had rejected calls from Western countries to give Mr Liu permission to seek palliative treatment elsewhere, with Chinese medical experts insisting that he was too ill to travel.
However, a German and an American doctor who had recently visited and examined him in the hospital said he would be able to travel abroad.
Mr Liu died ""peacefully"", surrounded by his wife and other relatives, his main doctor Teng Yue'e said. His final words to Liu Xia were: ""Live on well"".
In a brief statement, Shenyang local officials said that Mr Liu had suffered multiple organ failure, and that efforts to save the activist had failed.
Calling the death ""premature"", the Nobel Committee also said the Chinese refusal to allow him to travel was ""deeply disturbing"".
Germany, which was one of the countries considered as an option to Mr Liu, regretted that his transfer did not take place, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said.
""China now has the responsibility to quickly, transparently and plausibly answer the question of whether the cancer could not have been identified much earlier,"" he added in a statement.
The country, alongside the UK, US and France, called on China to allow Liu Xia to travel and leave the country if she wished.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a statement: ""Liu Xiaobo should have been allowed to choose his own medical treatment overseas, which the Chinese authorities repeatedly denied him. This was wrong and I now urge them to lift all restrictions on his widow.""
The call was endorsed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who urged China to ""guarantee Liu Xia's freedom of movement"".
Praise has poured in for Mr Liu, with US President Donald Trump calling Mr Liu ""a courageous advocate"" who ""dedicated his life to the pursuit of democracy and liberty"".
Coverage on mainland China has been muted. Xinhua and CCTV news issued short statements on their English sites stating that Liu Xiaobo, ""convicted of subversion of state power"", had died.
Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times said Mr Liu was ""a victim led astray"" by the West.
""The Chinese side has been focusing on Liu's treatment, but some Western forces are always attempting to steer the issue in a political direction, hyping the treatment as a 'human rights' issue,"" the newspaper added.
Social media users have also noticed attempts from censors to quell reaction online.
Many comments appear to have been deleted, including messages with ""RIP"" or candle emojis, popular when commemorating someone who has died.
A university professor turned tireless rights campaigner, Mr Liu was branded a criminal by authorities, and repeatedly jailed throughout his life.
Liu Xiaobo played a significant role in the Tiananmen Square student protests of June 1989, which ended in bloodshed when they were quashed by government troops.
He was subsequently placed in a detention centre and released in 1991.
Mr Liu's campaign to free those detained during the Tiananmen Square protests landed him in a labour camp in north-eastern China for three years, but he was permitted to marry poet Liu Xia there in 1996.
He was later freed, and continued to campaign for democracy.
The 11-year jail term he was serving was handed down in 2009 after he compiled, with other intellectuals, the Charter 08 manifesto. It called for an end to one-party rule and the introduction of multi-party democracy.
Mr Liu was found guilty of trying to overthrow the state.","The activist, who had been serving an 11-year prison term for ""subversion"", died in a hospital in China aged 61. Amid tributes for the late campaigner, the Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize, called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience in China. The activist, known for his advocacy of human rights and democracy, had been a prominent figure in the pro-democracy movement in China. During his time in prison, he had faced harsh conditions, including reports of torture and mistreatment.

The news of his death sparked international condemnation, with human rights organizations and politicians expressing their sadness and demanding justice for the activist. The Nobel Committee stated that his commitment to nonviolent protest and his relentless fight for human rights made him a deserving candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.

The Chinese government, however, responded with denial and dismissed the calls for the release of prisoners of conscience. They stated that the activist had been lawfully imprisoned, and his death was a result of natural causes.

Despite China's resistance, the international community continued to show support for the activist and his cause. Several countries, including the United States and European nations, called for an independent investigation into his death and the treatment of prisoners in China.

The death of the activist has fueled further concerns about China's human rights record and its treatment of dissent. It has also highlighted the need for continued pressure and advocacy to protect the rights of individuals who stand up for democracy and freedom of expression in China."

In Friday's tweets, Mr Trump lambasted ""Obstructionist Democrats"" for hindering his security plans, which appeared to refer to legal efforts to block his travel ban in US courts.
On Thursday, Mr Trump condemned the attack in Spain before he urged his Twitter followers to look into General John Pershing's actions during the US war in the Philippines in the early 1900s.
According to the debunked myth, the US commander rounded up 50 terrorists and ordered his men to shoot 49 of them, using bullets dipped in pig's blood. Pigs are considered ritually unclean in Islam. It is claimed the survivor was told to go back and tell his people what happened.
However, historians and fact checkers say there is no truth to the story.
Mr Trump has faced sharp criticism for his inconsistent response to terrorist attacks and hate crimes.
Earlier this week, he declined to label the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, a terror attack after the Justice Department announced it was investigating it as an act of terror.
A driver there barrelled a car into a group of counter-protesters at a far-right rally, organised by white supremacists and neo-Nazis, killing a woman and injuring 19 others.
The president said ""all sides"" were to blame for her death and the violence.","The president also called on US courts to ""give us back our protective rights"" in order to be tough on terrorism. It comes a day after Mr Trump urged people to ""get tough"" and ""fight back"" against terrorism in the wake of the recent attacks in London. The president's statement seems to indicate that he believes current legal protections may hinder efforts to combat terrorism effectively. However, it is worth noting that the US legal system is designed to uphold constitutional rights and ensure due process, even in times of crisis. It remains to be seen how and to what extent the president's call for the restoration of protective rights will be received and acted upon by the US courts."
"Last March, the government appointed former health minister Lord Norman Warner as external commissioner to oversee the running of children's services. Ministers have had his progress report since April, but will not say when it will be released.
One young woman's experience of being in the care of the authority saw her being moved 39 times in just five years and raped several times while in care.
Danielle, who has waived her right to anonymity, was taken into care in 1998 at the age of 11, after slash marks from a belt were spotted on her back when she changed for PE at school.
She told BBC Inside Out West Midlands the first of the 39 moves she went through saw her transferred six times in the first six weeks.
""I don't think any of us ever felt safe,"" Danielle, who is now in her 20s, said.
""Half of us ran away because it was safer to run away than to be in the home sometimes.""
When she was 11 years old, she said, someone tried to rape her in the children's home she was staying in and aged 13 she ran away.
""[I] got tricked into going to this flat and I got locked in.
""Then he started calling people and they kept me there for hours and I got gang raped. They locked me in a cupboard and wouldn't let me go.""
By the time she left the care system at the age of 16, Danielle had been raped three times.
As she left in 2003, a new director of children's services was appointed in Birmingham.
Peter Hay inherited a zero-rated service that was already on a government watch list, where it has remained.
""The first stage I think was to stop the thing falling off a cliff,"" he said.
But high-profile cases have continued to come, including those of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, who starved to death at her home in Handsworth in 2008, and Keanu Williams, who in 2011 was found collapsed in his mother's partner's flat.
Their deaths are among 23 serious case reviews published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.
Between 2009 and October 2013, the authority had four different strategic directors of Children, Young People and Families.

Four months after he started, a new, integrated agency hub was created to speed up the safeguarding process.
Birmingham Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (Mash) is based inside the council's headquarters and is made up of many organisations, including police, social workers and the NHS.
Christine Wellington, Mash head of service, said: ""Pre-Mash there was no feedback, there was almost the sense of 'what's the point of referring if nothing is going to be done?'.""
Now, when a safeguarding call comes in, it takes priority and the various agencies get together to discuss what action to take.
But one social worker who has worked for the council on more than one occasion - in 2012 and again this year - said his experiences had put him off going back.
The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said during his most recent time there, managers were being sacked, asked to leave and resigning, on a weekly basis.
He said he was ""fearful of a child death or a serious incident happening on my watch and I want to be able to sleep at night"".
The council has said a recruitment crisis in the department has been turned around - in contrast to May last year, when more than a quarter of frontline social worker posts were unfilled.
Social worker Siobhan Patton said her case load is the lowest it has ever been, down from 30 to 10.
And she said that was a big change from her ""lowest point"" - working from 06:00 until midnight.
Despite the council having to save millions of pounds from several departments, the authority has invested Â£30m in children's services over the past two years, which Mr Hay said was ""a real sign of that commitment to make this the number one service the council provides"".

Ministers have had his progress report since April, but have not yet disclosed its findings to the public. Many are calling for transparency and the release of the report to address concerns about the state of children's services.

Lord Warner's appointment as external commissioner was made in response to ongoing concerns about the quality of children's services across the country. As a former health minister, he was tasked with evaluating the current situation and making recommendations for improvement.

His progress report was submitted to the government in April. However, it has not been made public, and there has been no official explanation for the delay in releasing the findings. Some speculate that the report may contain damning assessments, leading to reluctance in making it public.

Various organizations and politicians are demanding transparency and the immediate release of the report. They argue that it is vital for the public to know the current state of children's services, especially as there have been longstanding concerns about the support and protection available to vulnerable children.

The delay in releasing the report also raises questions about the government's commitment to addressing issues within children's services. Critics argue that transparency is crucial for holding officials accountable and ensuring that necessary improvements are made.

Overall, the public is eagerly awaiting the release of Lord Warner's progress report on children's services. The findings are expected to shed light on the state of support and protection available to vulnerable children and determine the necessary steps for improvement."
"Crumlin Road Courthouse in north Belfast has been derelict for 15 years and is in a state of serious disrepair.
It is owned by a private developer, but the executive has asked consultants to find a way forward.
They think the best option is to repair the property and open courtroom number one as a tourist attraction.
The courthouse is a 160-year-old listed building, but a series of fires in recent years have left it without a roof.
Eight suggestions have been put forward for consultation, from doing nothing to options involving a hotel and restaurant.
The consultants favour an option that would reconstruct a courtroom, refurbish the ground and first floors, but mothball the basement and rear wing.
""It is really important something is done,"" said Justine Daly of consultants Turley Associates.
""It is physically linked to the jail by an underground tunnel and we could make that work by coming up into court one.""
Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland said consideration would have to be given to bringing the building back into public ownership.
The taxpayer would then face picking up the bill.
""I would suspect as it has been sitting in private ownership for quite a number of years and has been allowed to fall into disrepair that is not going to be the way forward,"" Mr McCausland said.
""It has to have some form of intervention. It is part of the cultural wealth of the city.""
Decisions will be made in the months ahead.","Crumlin Road Courthouse in north Belfast has been derelict for 15 years and is in a state of serious disrepair. It is owned by a private developer, but the executive has recently announced plans to acquire the building and restore it for public use.

The Crumlin Road Courthouse has a rich history, originally opening in 1850 as a courthouse and jail. The courthouse played a significant role in Northern Ireland's legal system, hosting many high-profile trials during the Troubles.

However, since it closed its doors in 1998, the building has been left to decay. The private developer who owns it has not taken any action to restore or maintain the property, leaving it to deteriorate and become a magnet for anti-social behavior.

Recognizing the historical and cultural importance of the courthouse, the executive has decided to step in and acquire the building. The restoration plans include preserving the courthouse's original features, such as its grand entrance hall, courtroom, and prison cells.

The restored Crumlin Road Courthouse will serve multiple purposes. It will provide a venue for public events, cultural performances, and educational activities, showcasing the history and heritage of Belfast. Additionally, the executive aims to create a memorial to the victims of the Troubles within the courthouse, ensuring that their stories and the impact of the conflict are never forgotten.

Thousands of fans attended the annual celebration of comic books and fantasy.
They were treated to a string of film and television teasers, among them new trailers for the upcoming Mad Max and Hunger Games films.
Attendees were also shown footage from an eagerly awaited episode of Family Guy in which the animated Griffin family travel to Springfield and meet The Simpsons.
A host of celebrities were on hand to preview their wares, among them Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino.
The latter used a panel appearance on Sunday to confirm he was pressing ahead with The Hateful Eight, the western project whose script was widely circulated earlier this year without his approval.
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe was also in attendance to promote Horns, a dark fantasy about a young man who begins to grow a pair of horns.
While there, the 25-year-old revealed he had used a Spider-Man mask and costume in order to walk around the massive convention incognito.
The first image of Wonder Woman was shown at a panel event on Saturday which saw Affleck share the stage with Superman actor Henry Cavill.
Gadot's costume drew a mixed response, with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton among those to compare her leather tunic and boots to those sported by Lucy Lawless in TV show Xena: Warrior Princess.
Footage released from Mad Max: Fury Road shows Britain's Tom Hardy and a shaven-headed Charlize Theron inhabiting the dusty post-apocalyptic world seen in the original Mel Gibson-led trilogy.

The tweet quickly went viral, with fans and media outlets expressing their excitement for the highly anticipated film.

Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman received some initial backlash when it was announced, with some questioning her ability to portray the iconic superheroine. However, many fans have since come to embrace and support her in the role, eager to see her bring Wonder Woman to life on the big screen.

Snyder's tweet and the subsequent buzz it generated created even more anticipation for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, as it gave fans a sneak peek of what to expect from Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman. The film, which brings together DC Comics' iconic superheroes Batman and Superman, is set to be a major blockbuster and kick off a new shared cinematic universe for DC's superheroes.

Bryant has scored 32,683 points during a 20-year career with the LA Lakers to rank third on the NBA's all-time list.
The two-time Olympic gold medallist, 37, has been hindered by injuries in recent seasons and has been below his best this year for the Lakers.
He told the Players' Tribune: ""My body knows it's time to say goodbye.""
Bryant has averaged more than 25 points per game in his 1,293 NBA matches.
Should the Lakers fail to make the end-of-season play-offs, his final game is set to be at home against Utah on 13 April.
The Lakers have won just two of their 16 matches so far this season, with Bryant averaging 15.7 points per game.
In a poem entitled 'Dear Basketball', Bryant announced ""this season is all I have left to give"".
The Philadelphia-born player added: ""You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream. And I'll always love you for it. But I can't love you obsessively for much longer.""
He ended the poem without hinting at what he might do next.
""We both know, no matter what I do next, I'll always be that kid, with the rolled up socks, garbage can in the corner, :05 seconds on the clock, ball in my hands,"" he wrote.
Bryant was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2008 and selected for the NBA All-Star team on 17 occasions.
He won Olympic gold with the United States in 2008 and 2012.
Lakers coach Byron Scott said he thought Bryant would have played on for at least another season.

"After a bright start for the home side, Hearts dominated the first half and only three good saves from goalkeeper Zander Clark kept them at bay.
Cummins pounced shortly after the break to divert a miss-hit Liam Craig shot with Hearts claiming for offside.
Callum Paterson, with a header against the bar, came closest to an equaliser.
But it was St Johnstone who secured their second win over Hearts this season - having beaten the Edinburgh side in the League Cup - to move into third place behind their opponents on goal difference.
To add to Hearts' disappointment, head coach Robbie Neilson was sent to the stand as his side pressed for that elusive leveller.
And Celtic now have a chance to extend their lead to five points with a game in hand when they travel to face Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Sunday.
The Hearts head scratching will go on for some time after what was a dominant display, but they had one man to blame for their defeat - goalkeeper Clark.
Clark has been standing in for the injured Alan Mannus, but his display was such that manager Tommy Wright will have a tough decision to make when his number one is fit and ready for action.
The 24-year-old pulled off two top-class, close-range saves in the first half - stage first from Faycal Rherras and the second from Sam Nicolson, who should have done better from six yards out.
As Hearts piled forward in the second half, he also denied Igor Rossi and then tipped a Tony Watt free kick over the bar.
Clark walked off the pitch to thankful back slaps from his team, respectful handshakes from the visitors and the fans singing his name.
St Johnstone under Tommy Wright have become a very difficult team to beat and even harder when they go ahead.
Every player knows his job and their organisation and work rate is consistent and impressive - and against Hearts it was no different.
Hearts' Robbie Neilson started with Sam Nicolson and Jamie Walker on the wings in a bid to stretch the match and flood the box with crosses.
In that sense, his game plan worked, but the Saints defence fought for every ball, challenged every cross and chased every lost cause.
After going ahead, they were doggedly determined to stay there and it was a frustrating afternoon for those in maroon.
The build-up to the match was dominated by Wright's comments about Hearts players going to ground too easily - and he said in the minutes before kick-off that he stood by his stance.
The Irishman was left looking rather sheepish though after two of his players were booked for simulation.
Goalscorer Cummins, in the first half, and substitute Chris Kane were both cautioned by referee John Beaton.
Neilson resisted the temptation to gloat, although he had his own problems after being sent to the stand.

St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We can get results like that through sheer determination and quality goalkeeping and a desire not to let the ball go in the net from everybody in the team, hard work, the odd wee bit of quality, probably not as much as I would like.

""I've got two number one goalkeepers - that's rare at football clubs and, having been a goalkeeper, I know that.
""Over the last six months, Zander has improved immensely and I don't think there is a better young goalkeeper in Scotland and I think he should be in and around that Scotland squad.""
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: ""I spoke to the players after the game and said we played some fantastic football and created some wonderful chances.
""But we didn't take them and got done with a sucker punch, but I'd rather play like that and be entertaining and exciting and create chances than go direct and hope to nick a goal.
""I thought we played really well to a man, but we just couldn't get the win our play deserved.

"A total of 22,503 people were left with unmanageable debts in the second quarter of the year, official figures from the Insolvency Service show.
That was a 22% rise on the same period last year, the data covering England and Wales show.
But an extensive period of low interest rates is expected to continue.
This is likely to keep a lid on the number of people falling irretrievably behind on loan repayments.
The rise in personal insolvencies were driven by a 15% rise in Individual Voluntary Arrangements - when those in debt come to an agreement on repaying debt with those to whom they owe money.
More traditional bankruptcies, when a debtor's home is at risk, have fallen in number.
Elsewhere in the UK, there was a 50% rise in individual insolvencies in Scotland over the same period, with 2,405 people going insolvent in the second quarter of the year.
There were 755 individual insolvencies in Northern Ireland in the second quarter of the year, an 8.5% rise on the same quarter a year ago.
Bankruptcy: The traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt. Ends after one year, but you are likely to lose all your assets, including your house, to pay something to the creditors
Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA): A deal between you and your creditors, overseen by an insolvency practitioner. Less stigma, less chance of losing your home, but involves paying some of your debts in one go.
Debt Relief Orders: Introduced in April 2009, these allow people with debts of less than £15,000 (£20,000 since October 2015) and minimal assets to write off debts without a full-blown bankruptcy","A total of 22,503 people were left with unmanageable debts in the second quarter of the year, official figures from the Insolvency Service show. That was a 22% rise on the previous quarter, marking the highest level since the second quarter of 2014. Personal insolvencies, which include bankruptcy, individual voluntary arrangements, and debt relief orders, all saw an increase during this period. Experts attribute this surge in debt to several factors, including economic uncertainty due to Brexit, rising inflation, stagnant wage growth, and an increase in borrowing through credit cards and personal loans.

The number of individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs), a popular debt repayment plan, reached a record high of 12,215 in the second quarter of the year, up by 19% compared to the previous quarter. IVAs allow individuals to pay back their debts over a set period, usually five years, without having to declare bankruptcy. Debt relief orders, which are a form of bankruptcy for individuals with very low income and minimal assets, also increased by 10% during this period.

These figures reflect the increasing financial strain faced by individuals in the UK. With inflation outpacing wage growth, many people are struggling to manage their debts and maintain their standard of living. The rising cost of living, coupled with the easy availability of credit, has led to more people accumulating unsustainable levels of debt.

Experts have warned that the situation may worsen in the coming months as the economic impact of Brexit becomes more apparent. Uncertainty surrounding trade deals and job security can exacerbate financial stress, leading to further increases in personal insolvencies.

The government and financial institutions are being urged to take steps to address this issue and provide better support for those in debt. This includes promoting financial literacy,"
"McCoy, winner of more than 4,300 races, will retire after riding at Sandown on Saturday, when he will be crowned champion jockey for the 20th time.
""Since he made the announcement it has been a huge sense of relief for me,"" wife Chanelle told BBC Radio 5 live.
""He goes to work every day with an ambulance following behind him.""
McCoy, 40, has been champion jockey every season since 1996 - his first year as a professional.
He was the first jockey to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year, after winning the Grand National for the first time at his 15th attempt.
In a career spanning almost 20 years, McCoy has broken bones in almost every part of his body.
Chanelle, his wife of almost nine years, said: ""There's a week to go to get him out in one piece. There will be sadness, but it will be a fantastic time and celebration.""
She said McCoy's forthcoming retirement only hit home after he raced for the last time at Cheltenham, where he has won two Gold Cups and three Champion Hurdles.
""He was a little bit choked after that,"" she said. ""It was probably the first time it has hit him.
""The day-to-day routine he will miss... the jockeys in the weighing room.""
Chanelle, who has two children - Eve and Archie - with McCoy, hoped her husband would retire in 2013 after he suffered a punctured lung following a heavy fall.
With air pockets around the heart, there was a high risk of a heart attack - something not revealed to the public at the time.
Chanelle felt her husband was thinking about retirement but, when he recovered and returned to racing, the injury became ""a distant memory"".
Her favourite moment was when McCoy reached 4,000 winners on Mountain Tunes at Towcester in November 2013, followed by winning the Grand National on Don't Push It in 2010.
""The day he won 4,000 winners and the children were there really stands out,"" she said. ""The Grand National was a fantastic day but 4,000 winners was special.""
Chanelle, who describes McCoy as ""a better person than he is a jockey"", is now looking forward to another memorable family day out.
""Sandown will be a celebration with friends and family,"" she said. ""We will leave emotion and emptiness for another day and not for Sandown.
""It will be a day of celebration, celebrating his career and - fingers crossed - he gets out in one piece, and remains injury free for the next week.""
Listen again to Chanelle McCoy's interview on BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek via the BBC iPlayer.","McCoy, winner of more than 4,300 races, will retire after riding at Sandown on Saturday, when he will be crowned champion jockey for the 20th time. ""Since he made the decision to retire earlier this year, it has been an emotional journey for McCoy, who has dedicated his entire life to horse racing. He has achieved monumental success throughout his career, breaking numerous records and becoming one of the most respected jockeys in the sport.

McCoy began his career in his native Ireland at the age of 17 and quickly made a name for himself with his exceptional talent and determination. His relentless drive for success propelled him to the top of the racing world, where he dominated the sport for over two decades.

Over the years, McCoy has faced countless injuries and setbacks, but his resilience and sheer willpower always brought him back stronger. His unparalleled work ethic and commitment to his craft have been an inspiration to many aspiring jockeys.

His retirement marks the end of a remarkable era in horse racing. McCoy's presence on the track will be greatly missed, but his legacy will continue to inspire generations of jockeys to come. His records and achievements will forever be etched in the history books, solidifying his place as one of the all-time greats.

As McCoy prepares for his final ride at Sandown, the racing world will gather to pay tribute to his extraordinary career. His fellow jockeys, trainers, and fans will celebrate his achievements and bid farewell to a true legend of the sport.

Although it is the end of his competitive career, McCoy's impact on horse racing will continue to be felt for years to come. He has not only raised the bar for jockeys but has also brought a new level of excitement and passion to the sport.

As he crosses the finish line for the last time, McCoy leaves behind a legacy of excellence, determination, and unrivaled success. His retirement marks the end of an era but also the beginning of a new chapter, as he starts a new journey in life.

While his presence on the track will be greatly missed, McCoy's legacy will live on, serving as a constant reminder of what can be achieved with hard work, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of greatness. Horse racing will forever be indebted to McCoy for his contributions to the sport, and he will always be remembered as one of the greatest jockeys of all time."
"A top official told the BBC there were ""limits"" to how long Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, would wait.
Under a deal which has halted fighting in Syria, only so-called Islamic State (IS) and a group previously officially linked to al-Qaeda can be targeted.
Meanwhile, the UN is still waiting to be able deliver aid to besieged Aleppo.
Some 20 trucks have been waiting for safe passage to cross from Turkey into Syria and on to rebel-held east Aleppo since the cessation of hostilities came into effect on Monday.
The UN however says it has not yet received permits from the Syrian government to allow the trucks into opposition areas, where at least 250,000 people are in desperate need of food and medicine.
Russia said Syrian government troops had begun to withdraw from Castello Road on the outskirts of Aleppo - the route through which the trucks will pass - on Thursday but this has not been independently confirmed.
Syrian and rebel forces are meant to pull back from the road to allow aid convoys through as part of the US-Russian deal which led to the cessation of hostilities.
A UK-based monitoring group said Russian troops were replacing Syrian government forces along the road.
Rebel groups said they would not withdraw from around Castello Road until government forces did.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told the BBC his country was confident that Syria would honour the ceasefire agreement but had ""more doubts about the opposition"".
He said the US needed to do more to persuade ""moderate"" rebel groups to disassociate themselves from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which is the strongest jihadist rebel group and is excluded from the ceasefire.
If the cessation holds for seven days, the US and Russia have agreed to jointly plan attacks on Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which was previously known as al-Nusra, and IS.
However, other rebel groups, many of them Western-backed, have shown no sign of separating from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, to which they are strategically allied in some areas.
The US ""have been promising to do the maximum possible to separate the moderate opposition from the Nusra Front since February"", when a previous cessation of hostilities deal was agreed, said Mr Bogdanov.
Since then, the US had been saying ""just hold on"", he said. ""We're waiting, but there are limits,"" the Russian official added.
Mr Bogdanov said the current deal was ""the only plan on the table"". ""We have no Plan B,"" he said.","A top official told the BBC there were ""limits"" to how long Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, would wait.

""It was just the noise we wanted to make and we've always followed our noses on that. The first rule of rock 'n' roll is, do what you want.""
The band's first single from Wilder Mind, Believe, had its first play on Radio 1 on Monday night.
Marcus Mumford says it was written after a friend's wedding in America last year.
""The boys wrote it in Texas,"" he says. ""We were all at a wedding and we were on this ranch.
""One of our best mates got married and the parents of the bride kindly let us stay on in this little outhouse for a week.
""I left a day early and by the time we'd met up again in London the boys had written this song, Believe.
And then I got in and started singing it and it was just great because normally there's a guitar in my hands.
""This is the first time in the band that I've just got to sing without having to worry about faffing with instruments. I really enjoyed it.""
Following the success of the band's 2012 release, Babel, Marcus Mumford and bandmates Winston Marshall, Ben Lovett and Ted Dwane took some time off.
Marcus says they got back together at the beginning of last year in America to write new material.
""We started doing demos at Aaron Dessner's garage [from The National] in Brooklyn, New York, about a year ago and started getting some songs together.
""And then when we were ready we went ahead in the autumn of last year and smashed it out.
""And now we're running around trying to learn how to play it live.""
Last week the band revealed they will be headlining this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals as well as announcing their own Stopover Festival, a two-day music and arts event which will take place near Aviemore.
Marcus Mumford says fans are in for something a little bit different with that one.
""That's going to be a lot of music,"" he says. ""We're putting on these festivals. It's kind of our favourite thing that we get to do as a band actually, to curate our own festivals, put together the line-ups.
""And it's not a headline Mumford & Sons show. It's a festival in small, out of the way towns.
""It's cool, because it's a destination gig, you will travel somewhere interesting and watch music for the weekend. It's great fun.""

"At least 800 firefighters and 170 fire engines are at a chemical plant in the city of Zhangzhou.
Firemen are battling the third in a series of blazes that began on Monday, when an oil leak caught fire and spread to nearby tanks.
More than 14,000 residents in the surrounding area have been evacuated, reported state news agency Xinhua.
Six people have been hospitalised for minor injuries, while 13 are receiving medical attention, said CCTV.
Xinhua said the fire began on Monday evening when an oil leak caught fire and led to blasts at three nearby oil storage tanks at the Tenglong Aromatic Hydrocarbon plant in Zhangzhou.
That fire was extinguished on Tuesday afternoon. It reignited that evening before it was put out again.
But another tank containing nearly 1,500 tonnes of hydrocarbon liquid caught fire and exploded early on Wednesday morning.
The plant produces the chemical paraxylene which is used for fibre and plastics.
Authorities said that the fires were reigniting due to residue being exposed to the air.
Experts interviewed by Xinhua said that the layer of foam sprayed by firefighters to cover the residue was becoming unstable due to the heat and was disintegrating, and was being shifted by strong winds.","At least 800 firefighters and 170 fire engines are at a chemical plant in the city of Zhangzhou. Firemen are battling the third in a series of blazes that began at the plant three days ago. The fire has been raging since then and has proved to be extremely challenging to control due to the volatile nature of the chemicals involved.

Local authorities have evacuated thousands of nearby residents as a precautionary measure due to the potential hazards posed by the fire. Emergency services are working around the clock to contain the blaze and prevent any further escalation.

The fire has already caused significant damage to the plant infrastructure, leading to concerns about potential environmental contamination. Efforts are being made to minimize the impact on nearby water bodies and air quality.

The cause of the initial fire is still under investigation, but authorities suspect it may have been triggered by an equipment malfunction. The rapid spread of the fire could be attributed to improper safety protocols or the presence of combustible materials on-site.

Firefighters are encountering numerous difficulties in extinguishing the flames, including limited access to certain areas due to collapsed structures and intense heat. Specialized firefighting foam and other resources are being employed to smother the fire effectively.

The company has apologised for the cancellations, which it said were due to trains needing repairs to damaged wheels.
Great Yarmouth MP Brandon Lewis said the situation was ""unacceptable"".
The rail journeys have been cancelled due to Abellio's diesel trains suffering wheel damage as a result of poor rail conditions.
""This situation leads to excessive wear on the wheels which must be repaired before the trains can re-enter service"", a spokesman for the train operator said.
""On average we are continuing to see two trains arrive back at the end of each day with wheel damage, more than double the rate we have experienced in previous autumn periods.""
Conservative MP Mr Lewis said: ""At a time when we are trying to encourage people into the centre of Great Yarmouth, this is just not good enough.

"The total, which was the highest in the report's nine-year history, accounted for 11.5% of the UK's total tax receipts.
The report highlights the potential hit to public finances if Brexit restricts access to the EU's single market.
Nearly a quarter of turnover ""went straight to the public coffers"".
The report, by accountancy giant PwC, said the record total was due in part to corporate tax reforms, which delivered an extra £8.4bn, and the bank levy, which resulted in lenders paying out £3.4bn.
However, the sector's contributions hang in the balance ahead of Brexit negotiations with the EU, said Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC.
""The report highlights an increasing reliance on tax receipts from banking and insurance firms,"" he said.
""With the added potential adverse impacts of Brexit on the sector, the question arises as to whether the current levels of tax contribution are sustainable.""
Financial firms in the UK have become increasingly concerned about their ability to trade with Europe after Brexit.
They are waiting to discover whether the UK can hold on to ""passporting"" rights, which allow lenders to trade freely across the EU.
The financial services sector currently employs 1.1 million people in the UK, or 3.4% of the national workforce.
Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, said access to skilled EU workers, the single market and financial services directives were among the areas of concern.
""As one of the UK's biggest service exporters, it's understandable the sector also contributes a considerable amount of tax. Despite this, the sector arguably stands most to lose as negotiations loom,"" he said.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would weigh up the ""costs and benefits"" of continuing to pay money to the European Union for access to the single market after it leaves the bloc.
Last week, the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said paying for access was a possibility.
Mr Hammond said: ""What he [Mr Davis] said was we wouldn't rule out the possibility of some ongoing contribution in some form if we have an ongoing relationship.
""And that would be something that we'd have to look at, looking at the costs, and looking at the benefits, and making a decision based on what's in the best interest of the British taxpayer.""
In a speech at a tax event on Tuesday, Jane Ellison, Financial Secretary to the Treasury said:
""We know that there will be a period of adjustment as we gear up to leave the EU. And we know that there is real uncertainty in this sector about what comes next.""
She said the government would be ""pressing for a deal that will help our vital financial services sector to be every bit as successful after our withdrawal as before"", adding that Brexit would mean ""new opportunities"".","The total, which was the highest in the report's nine-year history, accounted for 11.5% of the UK's total tax receipts.

"A spokesman for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films said Matheson died on Sunday in Los Angeles, but no other details were provided.
In a career spanning some 60 years, many of the author's works were adapted for both the big and small screens.
I Am Legend was his most successful, inspiring four film adaptations - most recently in 2007 starring Will Smith.
The novel was considered a landmark work in the genre, ushering in apocalyptic themes to post-WWII America.
Vincent Price starred in the first adaptation in 1964, titled as The Last Man on Earth.
Charlton Heston later starred in the 1971 adaptation, Omega Man.
The 2007 version saw Smith star as Robert Neville - the seemingly last human on Earth - trying to find a cure for a genetically-engineered virus that has turned the population into mutant vampiric creatures.
A low-budget adaptation I Am Omega was released the same year.
Born in Allendale, New Jersey, in 1926 and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Matheson first began publishing science-fiction and horror stories in the 1950s.
His earlier works adapted into films included 1953 novel Hell House, 1956's The Shrinking Man and 1958's A Stir of Echoes.
The 1978 novel What Dreams May Come was also adapted into a big screen version in 1998 starring Robin Williams, which won an Oscar for best visual effects.
Steven Spielberg's first feature-length film, Duel, was also based on Matheson's short story of the same name.
""Richard Matheson's ironic and iconic imagination created seminal science-fiction stories and gave me my first break when he wrote the short story and screenplay for Duel,"" Spielberg said in a statement.
""His Twilight Zones were among my favourites, and he recently worked with us on Real Steel. For me, he is in the same category as [Ray] Bradbury and [Isaac] Asimov.""
Matheson also worked as a writer for numerous TV shows including The Twilight Zone, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, The Martian Chronicles and Amazing Stories.
He penned the teleplay Nightmare at 20,000 Feet in 1963 for The Twilight Zone, which starred William Shatner and featured the famous shot of a gremlin peering into the window of an aeroplane from its wing.
He was also responsible for writing The Twilight Zone episode Steel, which inspired the 2011 Hugh Jackman film, Reel Steel.
Matheson is credited with influencing several generations of storytellers including Stephen King, who dedicated his 2006 novel, Cell, to him.
Matheson had been due to receive the visionary award at the Academy of Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Films' Saturn Awards on Wednesday.
The organisation said the award would be presented posthumously and ceremony would be dedicated to the author.","A spokesman for the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films said Matheson died on Sunday in Los Angeles, but no other details were provided.

Mr Peake is the first official UK astronaut. Previous ""British"" astronauts have either had US citizenship and worked for Nasa or been privately funded.
On the ISS he will conduct experiments.
He will also carry out  educational activities designed to get young people interested in science.

The Soyuz space capsule is due to dock with the space station at 17:23 GMT.
Helen Sharman became the first British citizen to travel to space when she visited the space station Mir in 1991. Her mission came about through a co-operative venture between the Soviet government and British business.
Ms Sharman told BBC News: ""Launch itself is a day that you want to get on with, because finally, you're getting to do what you've been trained to do for so long. I trained for 18 months, Tim Peake will have trained for six years by the time he flies.
""You're part of a great big machineâ€¦ by that stage, the team is so big - the doctors, the trainers - that you're not going to be able to go wrong.""
The crew are placed in quarantine for two weeks before launch to ensure they do not become ill in space.
They woke up at 02:00 GMT (08:00 local time) for breakfast and after a farewell ceremony, they left the cosmonaut hotel in Baikonur for medical tests.
After a break, they got into their white ""Sokol"" suits - which are worn during launch and re-entry - before saying final farewells to their families.
Then, at about 08:00 GMT (14:00 local time), the crew boarded a bus to the launch pad, where they rode the lift to the top of the Soyuz rocket.
Mr Peake and his colleagues will then be strapped into their seats so that they can prepare for launch.

Mr Peake is the first Briton to be employed as a professional astronaut by the European Space Agency (Esa).
German Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst, who was selected along with Mr Peake for the astronaut class of 2009, told BBC News: ""He's had 6,000 hours of training - a brutal amount over several years.
""He also went through preparation for launch earlier this year when he was on the back-up crew for another missionâ€¦ so he's now completely ready.""
Mr Gerst added: ""As an astronaut at this stage you're really relaxed. Mainly because your principal worry is that something will get in the way of launch; that you'll get ill or there'll be a technical problem.""
Richard Farrimond was one of four UK astronauts selected to launch satellites from Nasa's space shuttle in the 1980s, though the missions were cancelled after the Challenger disaster.
He told BBC News: ""Having met the man, I think he's quite superlativeâ€¦ I'm looking forward to seeing him up there on my TV screen.""
The mission might never have happened, however, had then-science minister David Willetts not successfully argued for an end to the UK government's longstanding opposition to human spaceflight. The change came about through negotiations in 2012 with officials from Esa.
Mr Willetts told BBC News that Mr Peake had been on the training programme, but - at that time - not part of the manned flight programme.
""Sadly he was very unlikely to get a flight up to the space station. We moved into participating in manned missions. The fact he's going to do some great science while he's up there has justified that decision.""

During his mission, Mr Peake will spend six months on the International Space Station, conducting scientific experiments and carrying out research in areas such as biology, human physiology, and astronomy. He will also be involved in educational outreach programs to inspire and engage young people in science and space exploration.

Mr Peake's journey to becoming an astronaut began in the British Army, where he served as an Apache helicopter pilot. He later became a test pilot and was selected for astronaut training in 2009.

"But the chairman, European Council President Donald Tusk, will keep the two discussions separate - despite concern that some jihadists are slipping into the EU posing as migrants and exploiting the freedom of movement provided by the Schengen zone.
At least two of the killers involved in the Paris attacks got in among the crowds of migrants arriving daily on the Greek islands near Turkey.
But EU leaders are anxious to avoid sounding like the nationalists who argue that the removal of border controls in the EU left Europeans more at risk from terrorists. That is the rallying cry of the French National Front (FN) and some other populist parties.
Migration and terrorism are also treated as separate issues because - as pointed out by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker - many asylum-seekers are themselves fleeing from the terror inflicted by Islamic State (IS), the Taliban and other extremist groups.
The dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality.
About 1.7 million EU citizens cross borders daily in the Schengen zone to go to work, the Bruegel think-tank reports.
And opinion polls indicate that many Europeans value Schengen more than any other change brought about by the EU.
But temporary border controls have been reimposed - by France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.
So the stakes are high at this summit.
""Our goal is clear: we must regain control over our external borders to stem migratory flows and to preserve Schengen,"" said Mr Tusk in his summit invitation letter.
Mr Juncker said Europeans now have ""one border"" and ""a shared responsibility to protect it"".
""We want to defend everything Schengen represents, and let me tell you that Schengen is here to stay,"" he told the European Parliament.
Saving Schengen means beefing up the surveillance of all people entering or leaving the Schengen area.
So in future EU citizens, as well as those from outside the bloc, will have their passports checked against police databases.
There is much work to do, however, to link up and improve those databases.
More than a million refugees and other migrants have surged into the EU this year, most of them desperate to reach Germany or other northern countries where job prospects are better, or where relatives can help them settle.
The Syrian war has pushed irregular migration to the EU to a record high.
There are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad.
So the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. The migrant registration process is still slow and patchy.
Turkey, struggling with more than two million Syrian refugees, now has much bargaining power. Critics say the EU risks compromising its human rights standards as it leans on Turkey to curb the migrant flow.
Greek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.
This week the Commission unveiled an ambitious plan for a new EU Border and Coast Guard to tackle problems on the EU's external borders.
The force - stronger than Frontex - would have 1,000 permanent staff and 1,500 reserves, who could be deployed rapidly to a trouble spot, within three days.
That could happen even without the host country requesting it - if the rest of the EU decides to take action.
Such force majeure might be the exception - but Poland has already raised objections on sovereignty grounds.
Once again, the migrant crisis is threatening to divide, more than unite, Europe.","But the chairman, European Council President Donald Tusk, will keep the two discussions separate - despite concern that some jihadists are slipping into the EU posing as migrants and exploiting the refugee crisis."
"""You are my friends,"" he told them.
""The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,"" he said.
A woman in the back of the auditorium shouted: ""Thank you."" A moment later a man took off his red Make America Great Again cap, waved it in the air and put it back on his head so he could clap with both hands - loudly.
Others in the 10,000-strong audience (National Rifle Association figures) - cheered.
Trump talked about Justice Neil Gorsuch and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke,  all of whom, the president made clear, support the Second Amendment.
He also spoke about his intentions: ""Let me make a simple promise,"" he said. ""I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.""
He didn't make any policy announcements, however, or discuss at any length legislation that's important to NRA leaders, such as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would make permits to carry concealed weapons valid across the nation.
He spoke only in generalities, breezing over specifics about firearms policy.
Still, he made the event feel like a ""victory party"", just as Arsenal Attorneys' Matthew Bergstrom, who was speaking at a firearms seminar that afternoon, predicted he would.
In the midst of the festive atmosphere, however, there were unresolved issues, and the relationship between Mr Trump and gun owners has been complicated.
The president likes to hold his cards close to his chest, and he often changes his mind.
This is true in the realm of foreign policy, trade deals and firearms policy too. In the past he's shown support for an assault weapons ban. Last year he reversed his position.
His fluid ideas about firearms policy have vexed those who care about the issue, whether they support fewer restrictions on gun owners or more.
Gun control is an emotionally raw issue in the US, where mass shootings have become surprisingly common.
Most Democrats think Americans would be safer with fewer guns, according to a McClatchy-Marist poll.
Near the convention hall, a woman in khaki shorts held up a sign: ""No Trump. No NRA. No guns.""
Most Republicans, however, believe Americans would be safer if there were more guns. Meanwhile, NRA executives want fewer restrictions on firearms.
With that goal in mind, the NRA gave $30m (Â£23m)  to Trump's presidential election campaign. Now he's their president. When it comes to the NRA's positions, though, he's been low-key.
Since taking office, he's struck down an Obama-era rule that would have made Social Security Administration officials add names of people who suffer from mental health problems and receive disability support to a database of individuals who cannot purchase a gun.
Beyond that, he hasn't done much in terms of firearms policy.
""For $30m?"" said Brendan Kelly, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a Washington-based organization, referring to the amount of money the NRA gave to his campaign.
""The only thing he's done is repeal a law.""
Mr Kelly is being sarcastic: he doesn't want Trump to follow the NRA's guidance and lift restrictions on firearms.
He wants the president to sign laws that will impose more rules on gun purchases and is disappointed in the way he's changed his mind about firearms policy.
Donald Trump once argued for stricter rules on gun purchases, and now he talks enthusiastically about the Second Amendment (and doesn't mention gun control).
""The inconsistencies get in the way,"" says Mr Kelly. ""He's bouncing back and forth, and people are dying.""
He wishes the president would argue for more restrictions on gun purchases. But that seems unlikely.
At the same time, it seems unlikely that the president will push for new policies loosening the restrictions on guns.
Activists at both ends of the political spectrum - from left to right - said they have been disappointed in the president.
For many of those at the convention, however, the policies were relatively unimportant. They said they were happy he'd come and liked the fact that he was surrounded by people whom they see as sympathetic to their cause.
Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to the president, spoke to a women's group at the event.
Flying on Air Force One, she told me she'd grown up hunting and used to bring home wild game: ""You have to prove your manhood,"" she said, joking around.
Trump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr also enjoy hunting.
""They love the outdoors,"" the president told people in the audience. (Donald Trump Jr, who's an NRA member, reportedly owns an AR-platform semi-automatic rifle.)
Stephen Miller, the White House policy director, has reportedly talked about how much he likes guns. He flew to Atlanta with the president.
NRA members said it was important to them that the president's friends and family are fond of guns.
""That's a really big trust factor,"" said attorney Stephen Halbrook, who was attending the convention.
The auditorium was filled with people wearing pro-gun messages on T-shirts, hats and badges.
One man wore a ponytail with flecks of grey and a black T-shirt that said: ""This is America. We eat bacon. We drink beer. We own guns. We love freedom. We speak English. If you don't like it, tough shit.""
They clapped loudly during the speech and seemed OK with the president's policy positions (or lack of them).
""I think you have to give him time,"" said Debbie Anderson, an NRA pistol instructor who was dressed in black (with a US flag bracelet). ""He can't get everything done in one day.""
Another person in the auditorium, John Greene, an NRA member who lives in Virginia Beach, agreed: ""He's been rather busy, doing a lot of things.""
In theory at least, the president was passionate about his commitment. ""I will never, ever let you down,"" he said.
A moment later he left, and the NRA members went back to the business of the convention: talking about guns and hanging out with their friends.
Follow @Tara_Mckelvey on Twitter","""You are my friends,"" he told them. ""The eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end,"" he said. A woman in the back of the room stood up, a skeptical look on her face. ""But what about the countless lives lost due to gun violence?"" she asked. ""Don't those lives matter too?""

The man paused for a moment, taking in her question. He realized that his celebratory words might have overlooked the painful reality faced by so many affected by gun violence. He took a step forward, his tone filled with empathy.

""You're right,"" he replied, his voice filled with conviction. ""Every life lost to gun violence is a tragedy, and we cannot ignore that. While I believe in upholding the Second Amendment, I also believe in finding common ground to address these pressing issues.""

He went on to explain his plan, acknowledging the need for comprehensive background checks, mental health evaluations, and increased support for law enforcement agencies to tackle gun-related crimes more effectively. He emphasized the importance of responsible gun ownership and education while acknowledging the need for stricter regulations.

""I understand that we may not agree on everything,"" he continued. ""But I believe in finding solutions that respect both our constitutional rights and the lives of those affected by gun violence. Together, we can work towards a future where we can feel safe and secure, while also addressing the concerns surrounding the Second Amendment.""

As he finished speaking, the room fell silent. The skepticism in the woman's eyes had softened, replaced by a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, in that moment, they realized that progress could only be achieved through understanding, compassion, and the willingness to find common ground, even in the face of deeply rooted disagreements."
"Five people from the UK died and an Australian man is still missing after the vessel, Leviathan II, sank near Tofino, British Columbia on Sunday.
The nurse, Sheila Simpson, who is originally from outside Strabane, County Tyrone, helped to comfort survivors at a nearby dock.
She said they appeared ""shell-shocked"".
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Simpson said: ""God put me there on the dock, and thank God for my training in Omagh [County Tyrone] and in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] in Belfast.
""I just stepped into the place where I could be of assistance.
""The survivors who could walk up off the deck were shell-shocked and I looked them in the eye and I put my hand to their back and I said 'you are alive, you have survived'.""
The nurse said she tried to provide ""reassurance"" to the traumatised passengers, adding that her experience of nursing in Northern Ireland meant she understood how ""trauma stays"" with survivors.
The victims have been named as David Thomas and his son Stephen from Swindon; Nigel Hooker from Southampton; Salford-born Jack Slater who had lived in Canada for many years, and Katie Taylor who was living in Whistler, British Columbia.
The missing man is 27 and a recovery operation is continuing.
Canadian investigators have said most of the passengers on the tourist boat were standing on the left side of the vessel when a wave hit it from the right.
They said the boat tilted before capsizing.
The passengers who survived were all in an enclosed part of the vessel.
There were 27 people on board in total and Canadian officials have said more could have died had it not been for the ""amazing response"" from locals around Tofino.
Fishing boats and other private vessels in the area helped to rescue survivors","Five people from the UK died and an Australian man is still missing after the vessel, Leviathan II, sank near Tofino, British Columbia on Sunday. The nurse, Sheila Simpson, who was aboard the vessel, survived the incident. Simpson, originally from the UK but residing in Canada, was rescued by a passing boat. She is currently receiving medical treatment for non-life-threatening injuries.

The Leviathan II, a whale-watching boat with 27 passengers on board, capsized near Tofino after encountering rough waters and strong winds. The boat was operated by Jamie's Whaling Station, a popular tour company in the area.

The bodies of the five deceased UK nationals have been recovered, and their identities have not been released at this time. The Australian man, who remains missing, has been identified as Nigel Hooker.

Search and rescue operations are ongoing to locate Hooker, although hopes of finding him alive are fading. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Coast Guard are leading the search efforts, with assistance from local volunteers and naval personnel.

The incident has sparked an investigation into the cause of the accident. Transport Canada, the federal agency responsible for transportation safety, will be examining the vessel, weather conditions, and other relevant factors to determine what led to the tragedy."

"Jamie Taggart, from the village of Cove in Argyll and Bute, failed to return from the trip last month.
Subsequent inquiries by his family revealed he had not been seen since 2 November, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house in the town of Sapa.
Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed.
Searches of the area, in the north of Vietnam, have been carried out for the 41-year-old.
Mr Taggart, who is also a retained firefighter, runs Linn Botanic Gardens in Cove, on the Rosneath peninsula.
His father Jim Taggart found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on 29 November.
Mr Taggart told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme his son had arrived in Vietnam two days before he went missing.
""I had four text messages from him then his mobile phone went dead,"" he said.
""His last text message said exactly where he was going.
""He was on his own but had been in that part of Vietnam two years previously and knew his way around.
""I don't think he got lost. Either something happened on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at.""
Mr Taggart added: ""He was found to be missing because he left his rucksack in the guest house he was staying in. When he didn't come back they phoned the police.
""He had left his passport behind. I understand that when travelling in Vietnam you have to have identity. But knowing Jamie, he may have deliberately left it in case he lost it on the hill.
""But two days of searching has produced a completely negative result.""
Jamie Taggart serves as a retained firefighter. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander for Argyll and Bute has also commented on the case.
Paul Connelly said: ""This is obviously an extremely difficult time for Jamie's family and friends and we can only hope there will be a positive outcome.
""Jamie has served his community as a dedicated and professional firefighter and is a popular member of a very close-knit and highly experienced team at Cove.
""There are a great many people who desperately want to see him return home safe.""
The botanist arrived in a guest house in Sapa on 30 October and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills.
On 2 November his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said it was aware that a British national had been reported missing while in the Sapa area of Vietnam.
He added: ""We are in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to their family at this difficult time.""
Prayers were said for Mr Taggart, a retained firefighter, at Craigrownie Church on Sunday.
He took over responsibility for Linn Botanic Gardens from his father in 1997.
In March of this year the attraction was added to Historic Scotland's Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes.","Jamie Taggart, from the village of Cove in Argyll and Bute, failed to return from the trip last month. Subsequent inquiries by his family revealed he had not been seen since he left for the trip. The 37-year-old avid hiker, known for his love of outdoor adventures, had set out to explore the rugged terrain of Argyll and Bute, a region renowned for its scenic beauty.

Concerned for his safety, his family contacted the local authorities who initiated a search operation. Rescue teams, including mountain rescue units, search dogs, and drones, scoured the area for any trace of Jamie. However, the search efforts yielded no results, leaving his family anxious and desperate for answers.

Jamie's disappearance has left the close-knit community of Cove in shock and disbelief. Described as a friendly and adventurous individual, Jamie was actively involved in local community activities and was well-liked among his peers. Many residents have come forward to assist in the search, organizing volunteer groups to comb through trails and mountains in the hope of finding any clue that might lead to his whereabouts.

As time passes, his family and friends grow increasingly concerned for his welfare. The uncertainty surrounding his disappearance weighs heavily on their hearts, as they hold onto the hope that he will be found safe and sound. Vigils and candlelight ceremonies have been organized by the community to provide support for Jamie's loved ones during this difficult time.

The local authorities are urging anyone with information regarding Jamie's disappearance to come forward. They are particularly interested in speaking with anyone who may have seen him on or around the days he went missing. Combining all available resources, they continue to tirelessly investigate every lead in the hopes of unraveling the mystery surrounding his disappearance.

Meanwhile, the community of Cove remains united in their efforts to bring Jamie back home. They have vowed to continue searching, spreading awareness through social media, and providing comfort to Jamie's family. The strength of their solidarity and determination serves as a testament to their unwavering support for one of their own, as they refuse to give up until Jamie is found."
"The 20-year-old was targeted by Hearts earlier this summer and Hull are now reportedly interested in the Scot.
""We want to improve players and, like most clubs in this country, we want to sell them at the right time and for the right amount of money,"" Lasley said.
""We are a fan-owned club, so we need to make the sums add up.""
As Lasley explained, the timing of any offer can be just as important as the transfer fee involved.
""It's got to be the right price at the right time and until that happens the players won't be going anywhere,"" he added.
""It's all right these moves happening, but it's when they happen as well - there's no point us letting someone go on the last day of the window and you have some money sitting in the bank. You can't play 'money' on a Saturday.
""That's the way it is but from our point of view that balance needs to be right for us before anything will happen.""
Well striker Louis Moult is another player to have been the subject of interest this summer.
Aberdeen had a bid rejected for the 25-year-old and Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson this week admitted he does not expect the player to extend his contract, which expires next summer.
Lasley, however, says the man who scored 18 goals in each of the past two seasons will continue to be a key figure for the Fir Park club.
""We made Louis a fantastic offer for our football club, he's declined it at the moment,"" he added. ""But we've got no doubt that regardless of the contract situation, he'll be giving his all to the club from now until the summer or whenever it is going to be.

"The cycle race begins in Leeds on 5 July and will travel through North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.
RICS said the figures showed that £4.5m of the money had been taken from future council budgets.
Work includes resurfacing, road strengthening and installing signs.
The figures were obtained by RICS from councils in Yorkshire via Freedom of Information requests.
They show that North Yorkshire County Council has spent £4.2m.
In West Yorkshire, Kirklees Council, Bradford Metropolitan District Council and Leeds City Council have budgeted a combined total of up to £950,000.
Calderdale Council has undertaken £600,000 of work, entirely brought forward from future years.
The City of York Council made a £200,000 contribution to road maintenance from its Capital Contingency Fund.
In Sheffield, the city council has prioritised work on the route as part of its scheduled road maintenance programme.
Rob Hindle, chairman of RICS Yorkshire and Humber Regional Board, said he was concerned about the impact of Tour de France spending on future road maintenance.
""While we welcome the Tour de France coming to Yorkshire and all the economic benefits it will bring, we certainly hope that by bringing forward so much work on Yorkshire's roads to before the race, the region won't be left without adequate maintenance for years to come,"" he said.
""We don't want a feast today if it means a famine tomorrow.""
North Yorkshire County Council said that the work carried out on its roads ""would have been needed within the next five years anyway"".
""We have just brought forward that work in preparation for the race,"" a spokeswoman said.
""We haven't reduced future highway maintenance budgets as a result and money hasn't been diverted from elsewhere.""","The cycle race begins in Leeds on 5 July and will travel through North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. RICS said the figures showed that £4.5m of the money had been allocated to upgrading cycling infrastructure and promoting cycling in these areas. This included the creation of new cycle paths, improving road safety for cyclists, and implementing initiatives to encourage more people to cycle.

In addition to the allocated funds, RICS also stated that the race itself would bring significant economic benefits to the region. It estimated that around £40m would be injected into the local economy as a result of the race, through increased tourism and visitor spending.

Furthermore, the race was expected to provide a platform to showcase the beauty and diversity of Yorkshire to a global audience. This was anticipated to attract more visitors to the region in the long term, benefiting the tourism industry and providing a boost to local businesses.

Overall, RICS believed that the cycling race would have a positive impact on both the immediate and long-term economic development of Leeds and the surrounding areas."
"It is said to result from ScotRail's plan to introduce 200 new services, providing 200,000 additional seats each day.
The timetable changes are the result of the Scottish government's decision to retain 13 Class 170 diesel trains.
Public transport campaigners have welcomed the announcement.
However, they insisted additional track capacity would be needed if the Scottish government was to meet its promise of ""the largest programme of benefits to rail passengers seen in a generation"".
Scotland's Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: ""From 2018 passengers will benefit from more seats, more services and faster journey times as a direct result of the increased funding that we are putting into the rail network.
""The retention of these units will complement the arrival of our new High Speed Trains, which will allow for new and improved intercity connections.
""They will also make our rail network more resilient, creating opportunities to run faster services on key commuter routes and offering better connectivity for regional areas.""
Phil Verster, Managing Director of Abellio ScotRail, described the announcement as ""a really significant moment in our mission to transform Scotland's railway"".
He added: ""In three years' time, the service that we provide to our customers will be unrecognisable.""
The plan also promises;
Colin Howden, from public transport campaign group, Transform Scotland, welcomed the announcement, but he said unless there were ""concrete commitments"" to upgrade routes then the network might not be able to take the added services.
He explained: ""It's certainly going to be difficult to get more trains on the route from Dundee to Aberdeen unless there is a clear and transparent decision by government to upgrade the single track rail line at Montrose.
""Services from the Edinburgh to Perth are severely constrained by capacity limitations on the Fife Coast and the long single track section on the approach to Perth.
""In our view, the most significant single improvement that could be made would be the re-creation of a direct route from Edinburgh to Perth.
""This would not only dramatically change journey times from Perth and Inverness to Edinburgh but would also reduce journey times from Aberdeen by routeing some trains via Perth. That would represent a 'rail revolution' for the Scottish inter-city network.""
Sarah Beattie-Smith, from the Scottish Greens, welcomed the plan to increase services but claimed it was not enough.
She said: ""The SNP seems to think that tinkering with train service numbers is enough to fix Scotland's broken public transport system. Don't get me wrong - new rail services are all well and good, but this policy falls far short from the 'rail revolution' the Scottish Government wants to brand it as.
""To properly support the people who are currently isolated by our poor and expensive public transport, we need to do much, much more.""","It is said to result from ScotRail's plan to introduce 200 new services, providing 200,000 additional seats each day. The timetable changes are the result of the Scottish government's decision to invest £475 million in improving Scotland's rail network. This investment will enable ScotRail to increase the frequency of trains on several key routes, as well as introduce new services to previously underserved areas.

The aim of these changes is to provide passengers with a more reliable and convenient rail service, reducing overcrowding and improving overall journey times. By introducing 200 new services and 200,000 additional seats each day, ScotRail hopes to entice more people to choose rail travel over other forms of transport, such as driving or taking the bus.

The Scottish government's decision to invest in the rail network is part of a broader effort to promote sustainable and environmentally-friendly modes of transportation. By improving rail infrastructure, the government aims to encourage more people to use public transport and reduce reliance on private cars, ultimately helping to tackle climate change and air pollution.

Overall, the timetable changes resulting from ScotRail's plan to introduce new services and the Scottish government's investment in the rail network are expected to benefit both passengers and the environment. With more frequent trains and additional seating, passengers can enjoy a more comfortable and efficient rail journey, while also taking a step towards a greener future."
"David Smith, from Galston, was found guilty of the attacks, which took place over a 16 year-period from 1975 to 1991 in the East Ayrshire town.
He was also convicted of sexually abusing a third girl and physically abusing two girls and a boy.
Smith denied the charges against him and claimed his victims were ""scheming"" and ""liars"" but was convicted following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.
Jailing him, judge Lord Matthews told Smith: ""You committed a catalogue of physical and sexual abuse towards children.
""I have seen the victim impact statement which detail in graphic detail your offending. Mere words are inadequate to describe your actions.""
Smith was described by one of his rape victims as always being ""touchy-feely"".
She was first abused by him at seven years old and first raped when she was 10.
The victim told advocate depute Bruce Erroch, prosecuting, that Smith had ""stolen her childhood"".
He raped her on various occasions between June 1979 and June 1985.
The victim, who is now 45, told the jury that Smith would also beat her with a belt, a poker, a shovel and a wooden spoon.
His other rape victim, now aged 39, told the jury: ""I've blocked most of what he did to me out. It was the only way I was able to survive.""
First offender Smith was also convicted of sexually abusing a third girl between February 1976 and February 1979.
Smith, who is also known as Darter, engaged in sexual activity with one of his rape victims while she was sleeping in bed with his other rape victim.","David Smith, from Galston, was found guilty of the attacks, which took place over a 16 year-period from 1975 to 1991 in the East Ayrshire town. He was also convicted of several other crimes including sexual assault, rape, and kidnapping. Smith targeted vulnerable individuals, often young women and girls, and used various methods to gain their trust before attacking them. The attacks caused significant trauma and distress to the victims, many of whom were unable to come forward until years later due to fear and shame.

During the trial, evidence was presented that linked Smith to the crimes, including DNA evidence and witness testimonies. The court heard harrowing accounts from the victims detailing the physical and psychological impact of the attacks.

After a thorough investigation and a lengthy trial, the jury unanimously found Smith guilty on all charges. The judge handed down a substantial sentence, recognizing the severity of the crimes committed and the lasting harm caused to the victims.

The community in Galston was shocked and saddened by the revelations of Smith's crimes. Many expressed their support for the victims and their hope for justice to be served. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting survivors of sexual violence and working towards preventing such crimes in the future."

The country's main east-west highway was blocked and residents are asking for equipment to clear up debris.
The boulders were loosened by two hours of heavy rain on Monday.
Floodwaters smashed through brick walls and carried cars, animals and furniture through Chosica's streets.
The state of emergency was called for 60 days to give powers to the local authorities to re-establish power and water supplies, and initiate a clean-up operation.

A 1967 mudslide in Chosica killed 64 people.","A torrent of mud and water sent car-sized boulders crashing through the town of Chosica, 47 km (29 miles) from the capital Lima. At least seven people were killed and many more were injured or missing. The flash flood occurred after heavy rains caused a nearby river to overflow, triggering the mudslide. The torrent swept away houses, vehicles, and infrastructure, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

Rescue teams, along with local authorities and volunteers, launched an immediate search and rescue operation to find survivors trapped in the debris. However, the difficult terrain and the intensity of the mud had slowed down the efforts.

The affected residents were evacuated from their homes and temporary shelters were set up to provide them with food, water, and medical assistance. The government declared a state of emergency in the"
"Jay McEveley diverted a Blair Alston cross into his own net for the opener.
Martin Woods' second-half shot deflected into the path of Craig Curran, who duly levelled.
But substitute Kane's brilliant floating effort found the top corner in the final minute of normal time.
St Johnstone look certain for a top-six finish. They are chasing teams above them now having established an 11-point cushion in fifth place.
Kane's late winner was dramatic, timely and on balance looked deserved as Saints were the better side overall. They took their chances whereas County did not.
The loss of Murray Davidson to an early thigh injury was catered for with the introduction of Keith Watson, and a couple of positional changes.
They coped with that setback well, as they did when County equalised, and some refereeing decisions did not go their way.
Alston hit the post early on with a neat flick but Saints went ahead when the midfielder squared dangerously across the six-yard line.
Steven MacLean pressured McEveley enough to force the defender to touch into his own net.
Liam Craig cracked a post direct from a corner but the main source of frustration came when referee John Beaton somehow did not see Woods clearly handle Watson's header on the line.
They might also have had a penalty awarded when Richard Foster was caught on the edge of the box.
MacLean was very unlucky with a superb touch and shot which was brilliantly saved by Scott Fox.
The great thing about this squad is they deliver consistently and did so again. As the clocked ticked, Kane took control and his winner, soaring into the top corner, was a thing of beauty.
County's recent results at home have been damaging - this was their third straight defeat in Dingwall in all competitions, and the result adds pressure given the compact nature of the Premiership's bottom seven teams.
No significant damage was done in terms of league position but results like this might count further down the line.
There were key moments in this game that did not go their way.
Before St Johnstone's opener, Joe Shaughnessy appeared to handle in the box but whether that was intentional was unclear.
It is possibly more fruitful to consider things that can be directly controlled and Michael Gardyne blazed a fabulous chance miles over from inside which would have changed the complexion of the game.
When Gardyne redirected a long diagonal off an upright, you started to wonder if it was just not their day.
Liam Boyce was unlucky with a curling effort, as was Milan Lalkovic.
Their goal had a touch of fortune in that Woods' shot deflected straight to Curran, who delighted in curling home on his return to the starting line-up.
To lose the point so late in the game will be extremely frustrating, with a couple of testing fixtures to follow against Aberdeen and Hearts.
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: ""That's two weeks in a row we've lost a late goal and it's a real sickener given the effort we've put into the game.
""We got ourselves back into the game and didn't punish St Johnstone when we had the opportunity to.
""The most glaring opportunity was Gardyne's shot from eight yards which sailed over the bar. That was a big moment in the match.
""Nothing really changes. It's still very tight. Nothing is going to be decided over the next three or four games because you would class them as a harder run of fixtures.
""We've done it already this season at Ibrox and Tynecastle where we've put in really good performances and picked up points. There's nothing to say we won't go and do that again.""
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""I thought we were excellent. I do think we deserved to win on the number of chances we created.
""We were good with the ball when in possession. We were excellent in terms of counter-attacking all day.
""We showed character again but it's a wonderful goal to win the game and it came at the right time.
""We knew if we beat them [Ross County] we'd go 13 [points] ahead of them and that's a big number to make up between now and when the split comes.
""We can't rest. We can't think we're in the top six. You've got to go out and do it week in, week out.""

"Holyrood's health and sport committee also accused the SFA of being ""asleep on the job"" over the issue.
The committee launched its inquiry after allegations emerged of young footballers being abused by coaches.
BBC Scotland later found that 2,500 youth football coaches did not have full background checks.
The committee said there was a ""compelling case"" for the current voluntary Protecting Vulnerable Groups scheme (PVG) to be made mandatory for all sports organisations in Scotland.
The Scottish government plans to have new legislation in place by 2019.
But the committee said it believed action needed to be taken now to strengthen the PVG scheme and to ensure ""unsuitable people"" were prevented from doing regulated work.
It also called for a strengthening of the ""minimum operating requirements"" that sport governing bodies are required to meet in relation to child protection.
And it recommended that future grants from SportScotland to governing bodies be ""conditional on adequate procedures not only being in place but being timeously adhered to"".
The report highlighted concerns raised about a backlog of checks waiting to be carried out on coaches and officials working with young footballers.
Committee members also said the Scottish Youth Football Association (SFYA) ""misled government officials and the committee in relation to the levels of backlog being experienced since at least August 2016"".
Committee convener Neil Findlay said the evidence had highlighted variations in how the PVG scheme operates in sports across Scotland.
The Labour MSP added: ""Ultimately, we believe the current system of PVG checks may not be preventing unsuitable people from doing regulated work with children.
""We're talking about the safety of children - urgent action is needed now to strengthen the scheme as 2019 is too long to wait for new legislation.""
Mr Findlay said the committee had raised ""serious concerns"" about the ability of the SYFA to ensure PVG checks were carried out efficiently.
He said: ""We cannot, even now, be confident that the SYFA is being truthful in relation to the size of their backlog and consequently that as an organisation they are committed to undertaking the appropriate PVG checking expeditiously.
""We consider the SFA to have been asleep on the job and continuingly complacent in this area. Based on the information provided, we are left with concerns about the current protections being afforded to youth footballers in Scotland.""
The PVG scheme, which has been in operation since 2011, is a registration system for people who work, whether paid or unpaid, with children and protected adults.
The checks are carried by Disclosure Scotland and searches are made of databases, including criminal records.
A spokesman for the SYFA said it placed the safety of Scotland's youth footballers at the heart of everything it did.
He added: ""We are one of the country's largest users of PVG checks and register thousands of new officials every year.
""We have tightened our procedures in recent months and are amongst the very best-performing youth sports bodies in the country when it comes to ensuring Disclosure Scotland checks are carried out in a timely fashion.
""We are very disappointed with comments that we in any way misled anyone about our procedures and have been open and honest in all our dealings with the parliament.""
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the SFA said it was in ""full agreement"" that the PVG scheme should be overhauled as soon as possible.
But he said the organisation ""strongly refutes and does not recognise"" Mr Findlay's claim that it was complacent over the issue.
The spokesman added: ""The responsibility for PVG checks in youth football rests with the Scottish Youth FA. It is important to stress that all coaches and staff engaged directly by the Scottish FA are fully compliant with the PVG legislation.
""We are fully aware of our own responsibilities as the governing body and reiterate our commitment to reassuring young players and parents that Scottish football is a safe environment in which to play.""
Sport Minister Aileen Campbell said: ""The deputy first minister announced a review of the PVG scheme last year which will review all aspects of the scheme.
""The review will lead to a formal consultation and we will take forward any legislation necessary to ensure the PVG scheme retains its essential purpose of safeguarding.""
BBC Scotland revealed in December that 2,500 of the 15,385 coaches registered with the SYFA did not have PVG clearance.
The SYFA said it would tighten up its procedures - with hundreds of youth football coaches and officials and 18 youth football clubs from across Scotland subsequently being suspended for failing to complete the background checks.
It later emerged that 14 of the 45 sport governing bodies that responded to a BBC Scotland query may also have unchecked coaches.
Sports organisations gave a number of reasons for coaches not being checked at the time of the survey.
Some coaches are self-employed, others are involved with school clubs where the local authority was responsible for checks, some were in the process of becoming qualified, while some were doing unregulated work that did not require a check.
More than 20 UK police forces - including Police Scotland - have confirmed they are investigating claims of historical child abuse in football.
A BBC Scotland investigation revealed that former youth coach and referee Hugh Stevenson was allowed to carry on working in football for several years after being reported to police and the SFA over child sex offences.
And Jim McCafferty, a former youth coach who was the kit man for Celtic, Hibernian and Falkirk, was arrested in Belfast after allegations were made against him.
Separately, allegations have also been made against coaches who were formerly involved with clubs including Motherwell, Partick Thistle and Rangers.
The allegations involve incidents said to have happened between the 1970s and early 1990s.","Holyrood's health and sport committee also accused the SFA of being ""asleep on the job"" over the issue. The committee launched its inquiry after allegations emerged of young footballers being abused by coaches within Scottish football. The committee expressed its concern over the lack of action and oversight by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in tackling the issue. It accused the SFA of negligence and failing to protect young players from harm. The inquiry aims to examine the extent of the problem and propose measures to ensure the safety and well-being of all young individuals involved in football."
"Carlton Street car park which adjoins the bus station is being wrapped in scaffolding and screens, before work to remove it gets under way.
The Wyvern Theatre car park will also close in mid-August and be demolished by the end of the year.
The redevelopment is the latest stage in the Â£350m Kimmerfields development in the town centre.
The Princes Street multi-storey car park and adjoining apartments have already been built as part of the scheme.
Work to turn Fleming Way into a bus-only route is due to begin in 2016.
It will see the elevated section of the road lowered to pedestrian level and an ""uninviting"" subway removed.
Once the changes to Fleming Way have been completed the bus station will relocate to the western end of the road.
Developers say the area will include a ""linear park"" connecting the business district and the station to the north with shops and restaurants.
The project is being run by Forward Swindon, which is leading the regeneration on behalf of Swindon Borough Council.
Forward Swindon is an independent company established and funded by the council in 2010 to ""deliver and facilitate economic growth and property development in the town"".","Carlton Street car park which adjoins the bus station is being wrapped in scaffolding and screens, before work to remove it gets under way.

"The Grand National will attract about £225m in wagers across the betting industry, William Hill predicted.
Combined with other sporting fixtures it expects to take ""the highest turnover levels on any weekend in history"", the bookmaker said.
Saturday's race is expected to be seen by 600 million people globally.
""The Grand National is the public's race and we will see millions of once-a-year punters coming in to betting shops or downloading the app,"" William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said.
The race is set to attract over 35 million bets with the average being worth £4.41.
William Hill is also hoping for another big-priced winner in the Grand National this year. The last five races have produced winners at odds of 33/1, 25/1, 25/1 and 33/1.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary owns five of the 40 horses in Saturday's field. He is hoping to become the first owner to win consecutive Nationals with different horses since 1954 after Rule the World, ridden by David Mullins, claimed victory.
Last year the start time for the Grand National was moved by an hour to 17:15 BST. The decision proved to be a boost for turnover and William Hill expects that trend to continue.
""The experiment of moving the start time really paid off and we expect the Grand National to smash betting records this year,"" Mr Adams said.
Last year the number of bets placed on the Grand National on William Hill's online and mobile channels peaked at about 10,000 a minute.
It is the first year that the race has been sponsored by Randox Health, which analyses blood and urine samples to detect and prevent illnesses.

"The U's went ahead when Phil Edwards swept in from close range and Marvin Johnson's deflected cross-shot doubled their lead after the break.
Isaac Vassell pulled one back straight away with a shot on the turn and ex-Oxford striker Danny Hylton nodded in to level with eight minutes remaining.
But Johnson's fine strike from the edge of the box won the match for Oxford.
Oxford, who lost 3-2 to Barnsley in the final of last season's competition, will play the Sky Blues at Wembley Stadium on 2 April.
The match at Kenilworth Road was an entertaining encounter, with 35 efforts on goal.
Vassell had hit the crossbar for the hosts in the early stages before Luton fell behind, and Johnson cleared a header from the Hatters forward off the line with the score at 1-0.
Luton looked to have secured at least a penalty shootout after Hylton, who left Oxford for the Hatters in the summer, netted his 20th goal of the season but Johnson's goal from a quickly taken short corner proved the difference.
Even after that, U's keeper Simon Eastwood had to be alert to keep out an angled drive from Jack Marriott in the final minute of stoppage time.","The U's went ahead when Phil Edwards swept in from close range and Marvin Johnson's deflected cross-shot doubled their lead after the break.

Oxford continued to dominate proceedings and increased their lead in the 55th minute. Marvin Johnson's cross took a deflection off a Bournemouth defender and looped over the goalkeeper, finding the back of the net.

However, Bournemouth responded immediately and pulled a goal back just moments later. Isaac Vassell made a clever run behind the Oxford defense and latched onto a through ball before slotting it past the onrushing goalkeeper.

"Six world powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - and Iran are meeting in Istanbul in Turkey.
Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful, but critics suspect it of seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
Israel has hinted in recent months that it may carry out a pre-emptive strike.
Michael Mann, a spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, said of the talks: ""There is a positive atmosphere... contrasting with the last time.""
The BBC's James Reynolds, in Istanbul, says the envoys had earlier set the bar pretty low - saying they did not expect detailed, substantive proposals from either side.
What they wanted to see, he says, was whether Iran was ready to seriously engage and, if that happened, there might be another round of talks in four to six weeks time.
After a two-and-a-half-hour morning session, there was general agreement among the six world powers, known collectively as the P5+1, that there had been progress.
Mr Mann said: ""The principles for future talks seem to be there.""
One diplomat told Associated Press that Iran appeared ready to discuss its uranium enrichment programme and that the Iranian team had referred to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's ""fatwa"" on nuclear arms.
Another session later in the day involves bilateral meetings, possibly including a rare US-Iran encounter.
Ahead of the talks, Baroness Ashton said she hoped they would be ""the beginnings of a sustained process"".
""What we are here to do is to find ways in which we can build confidence between us and ways in which we can demonstrate that Iran is moving away from a nuclear weapons programme.""
Chief Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili said the talks would ""serve the dignity of the Iranian nation"".
US President Barack Obama earlier described this as a ""last chance"" for diplomacy to work.
The P5+1 hope eventually to persuade Iran to reduce its enrichment of uranium and fully open up its nuclear facilities to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
There are suggestions that the stringent sanctions on Iran could be reduced if it complies with the requests.
The last series of international talks broke down in January 2011 after the parties failed to agree on any issues.
Since then, the IAEA expressed concern that Iran had failed to co-operate with its inspectors and had carried out activities ""relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"".
Israel, which believes a nuclear-capable Iran would be a direct threat to its security, has warned that time is running out to prevent that outcome.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would never allow Israelis to ""live in the shadow of annihilation"", and hinted his country is ready to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy does not work soon.
President Obama has warned against ""loose talk of war"", while stressing that all options remain open.","Six world powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - and Iran are meeting in Istanbul in Turkey. Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful, but critics believe that Iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons. This meeting in Istanbul is aimed at discussing and negotiating the terms of a potential agreement to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities and ensure its peaceful nature.

The US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany, known collectively as the P5+1, along with Iran, have been engaged in negotiations for several years, trying to reach a comprehensive agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA was initially signed in 2015 but was later abandoned by the US in 2018.

Critics of Iran's nuclear program argue that the country has been clandestinely pursuing nuclear weapons under the guise of a peaceful program. They point to various factors, including Iran's past concealment of nuclear facilities and the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) suspicions about Iran's activities. Additionally, Iran's enrichment of uranium to levels beyond what is necessary for civilian purposes has heightened concerns.

Advocates of Iran's position maintain that its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity and medical research. Iran argues that it has the right to develop nuclear technology under the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). However, critics question Iran's intentions due to their previous lack of transparency and failure to fully cooperate with international inspections.

The goal of negotiations in Istanbul, and previously in Vienna, is to address these concerns and find a mutually acceptable solution that ensures Iran's nuclear program remains solely for peaceful purposes. This may involve imposing restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment levels, implementing rigorous inspections, and establishing mechanisms to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement.

The outcome of these negotiations will have significant implications for regional stability, non-proliferation efforts, and the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East."

"East Timor wants the court to decide who owns a large undersea oil and gas field.
East Timor says a 2006 treaty for revenue sharing was unfairly forced upon the newly independent nation.
Australia says the international court has no jurisdiction over the dispute.
On Monday, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ""held that it was competent to continue with the conciliation process"" brought by East Timor against Australia in April.
The Greater Sunrise oil and gas field lies between the two nations.
East Timor - also known as Timor Leste - welcomed the decision by the PCA - the world's oldest arbitration tribunal.
""Just as we fought so hard and suffered so much for our independence, Timor-Leste will not rest until we have our sovereign rights over both land and sea,"" said Xanana Gusmao, the independence resistance hero and former prime minister.
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said her country accepted the decision.
""We are committed to working together to strengthen our relationship and overcome our differences in the Timor sea,"" she said.","East Timor wants the court to decide who owns a large undersea oil and gas field. East Timor says a 2006 treaty for revenue sharing was unfairly forced upon the country by Australia. East Timor argues that the Greater Sunrise field should belong to them according to international law on maritime boundaries. The field is estimated to hold billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas reserves.

East Timor gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 and has been struggling to assert its rights over its maritime resources ever since. The dispute with Australia arose when the two countries negotiated a treaty on the revenue sharing of the Greater Sunrise field back in 2006.

According to East Timor, the treaty was signed under duress as it alleges that Australia conducted espionage during negotiations, using bugs planted in East Timorese government offices. These allegations led East Timor to initiate a case against Australia in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2016.

"In a new report, the IMF says that countries that export oil and other commodities have been severely affected.
Some emerging economies have been hit by sharp moves in the global currency markets.
And the report says financial stability is still not ""fully grounded"" in the rich countries.
""Risks to the global financial system have risen since October and have rotated to parts of the financial system where they are harder to assess and harder to address,"" said Jose Vinals, financial counsellor at the IMF.
The IMF acknowledges that recent declines in the prices of oil and other commodities are on balance helpful for global economic prospects.
But they create a major challenge for countries and firms that export them.
It says the strains in debt repayment capacity are apparent for oil and gas businesses in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria.
Debt servicing is also a concern for governments reliant on oil revenues such as Nigeria and Venezuela. Many other major oil exporters have sufficient reserves to enable them to cope with lower prices for some time.
Other developing nations, those that import commodities, do however benefit from these lower prices
Movements in the currency markets have also hit some emerging countries. The rise in the value of the dollar increases the repayment burden for firms and governments that have borrowed in the US currency. Some have also faced significant outflows of capital.
There is also a warning that there could be more of that when the US Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates, which is expected later this year.  It might happen smoothly, but the report says there is a danger that it might spark more volatility.
The report also says that there's a danger of property price declines in some countries, especially in China, which could spill over to emerging countries more widely.
In the rich countries very low interest rates - welcomed by the IMF for their economic benefits - do nonetheless pose some financial issues. Some European life insurers could struggle and low rates are reflected in more financial risk taking as investors seek better returns.
Some elements of this picture of rising risks reflects the aftermath of the financial crisis. The low interest rates in the rich countries, for example are part of the response to the economic damage, but they do create new risks.
The rising dollar is, indirectly, the result of the more rapid post-crisis rebound in the US compared with continental Europe.  Six-and-a-half years on from the most intense phase of the crisis, its long shadow remains.
Still, the IMF does see some more encouraging developments. In particular economic growth is expected to be slightly higher this year and next, which would tend to promote financial stability.","In a new report, the IMF says that countries that export oil and other commodities have been severely affected. Some emerging economies have been hit by sharp moves in the prices of their key exports, causing significant economic challenges. The report highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic decline in global demand and disrupted supply chains, leading to a sharp drop in commodity prices.

Oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Nigeria, have been particularly affected by the collapse in oil prices. The lockdown measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have caused a substantial decrease in oil demand, resulting in a surplus supply and a significant decline in prices. This has put enormous pressure on the finances of these oil-dependent economies.

Similarly, countries exporting other commodities, including metals, minerals, and agricultural products, have also experienced significant losses. For instance, the prices of copper and iron ore have been heavily impacted due to reduced global demand and disruptions in production and transportation. This has adversely affected countries like Chile and Australia, which heavily rely on such exports.

The IMF report warns that these economies face the risk of persistent challenges, as it may take a considerable time for global demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive policy responses, including diversification efforts, to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations. Additionally, the report underscores the importance of building solid fiscal buffers and implementing structural reforms to enhance resilience and promote sustainable economic growth in the long term."
"The Vulcan Hotel, which opened in 1853, was dismantled brick by brick last year, and is in storage.
St Fagans hopes to recreate the building as it would have looked in 1915, and ground works could start this year if permission is granted.
Museum officials are appealing for anyone with old pictures of the pub to get in touch.
Gerallt Nash, senior curator of historic buildings, said: ""We don't have many early pictures.
""If anyone remembers going there and can describe it, or have early photographs of the Vulcan, we would like to see them.""
Mr Nash said plans were submitted to Cardiff council last week.
He said: ""We have decided on the date we're going to represent when we rebuild it, which is 1915.
""It dates back to 1853, but it was substantially altered in 1914 and that's the period that's of greatest interest to us.
""We have got copies of plans prepared in 1914 for the building.""
Rebuilding plans include using the original tiles on the outside of the building, bearing the hotel's name.
Original features will also include a set of gents' ceramic urinals dating back to 1914 or further.
Mr Nash said running the pub as a working exhibit was an option.
It was once part of Cardiff's Newtown area and popular with the Irish community. The old suburb was cleared during post-war redevelopment.
The museum hope the pub will help tell the story of an expanding and changing Cardiff at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th Centuries.
The pub was bought by compulsory purchase order five years ago as part of redevelopments and last orders were called for the final time in May 2012.","The Vulcan Hotel, which opened in 1853, was dismantled brick by brick last year, and is in storage. St Fagans hopes to recreate the building as it would have looked during the mid-19th century. The Vulcan Hotel, originally located in Cardiff, Wales, was a historic establishment that had stood the test of time for over 150 years. However, due to various reasons including urban redevelopment plans in the area, it faced the threat of demolition.

Recognizing the importance of preserving this significant piece of the city's history, the decision was made to carefully dismantle the Vulcan Hotel in 2020. Each brick was meticulously removed and safely stored for future use. This process ensured that the building's architectural elements and unique character would be accurately replicated during its reconstruction.

St Fagans National Museum of History, situated just outside of Cardiff, took on the responsibility of recreating the Vulcan Hotel. The museum, well-known for its collection of historic buildings, aims to provide visitors with an authentic experience of Welsh history and culture.

With its extensive knowledge and expertise in historical reconstruction, St Fagans intends to bring back the Vulcan Hotel to its former glory. The process will involve meticulous research, utilizing archival photographs, documents, and testimonies from individuals who remember the hotel during its heyday.

The reconstruction of the Vulcan Hotel will not only involve rebuilding the physical structure but also ensuring that the interior and decoration reflect the mid-19th century ambience. St Fagans intends to recreate the atmosphere, decor, and even the furniture to offer visitors an immersive experience into the past.

Once the reconstruction is complete, visitors to St Fagans will have the opportunity to step back in time and explore the Vulcan Hotel as it would have appeared in the"
"Manchester United's loan deal for Radamel Falcao will capture the headlines - but there were other vital issues to emerge as a hectic 24 hours came to a conclusion.
Here we look at some of the key points and who can emerge with satisfaction from this summer's window.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was under serious pressure to bring in a striker after Olivier Giroud was ruled out injured for three months - especially after Manchester United pulled off the coup of landing Radamel Falcao, who had been strongly linked with the Gunners.
And, after a day that started with Manchester United's England striker Danny Welbeck being linked with Tottenham, he ended up in north London with Arsenal in a deal confirmed at 01:00 BST.
Welbeck, 23, has never been a prolific goalscorer but Wenger clearly believes the raw materials are there to work with. It is a practical signing which Arsenal will hope develops into an excellent one.
The move brought a mixed response from Arsenal fans, who may have wished for a so-called bigger name, particularly the Old Trafford-bound Falcao, but Welbeck is an England international with an exemplary attitude and there is room for his game to grow.
There was an inquiry made for Manchester City's Matija Nastasic as Wenger pondered strengthening his defensive resources and some will question the absence of a powerful central midfield player.
Wenger, however, has a strict transfer policy of refusing to pay over the odds or simply making a signing for a signing's sake.
Now it is up to Welbeck to repay the faith - and there is every chance he will improve under Wenger's guidance.
Chelsea and Manchester City spent transfer deadline day pruning the margins of their squads, or in the latter's case accepting an offer from Valencia for Alvaro Negredo that includes an obligation to complete a 30m euros deal at the end of the season.
Both clubs had clear plans in place for the players they wanted to bring in, those they wanted out - with City also securing all of the big contract renewals for key players.
Chelsea moved swiftly to sign Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, as well as defender Felipe Luis, so manager Jose Mourinho was able to enjoy a relatively relaxed deadline day. The main business was done.
Costa, in particular, and Fabregas have both made outstanding starts. It has been a smooth transition.
City's summer was well structured. Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando were earmarked some time ago and they were able to avoid any late panics or trolley dashes.
Like Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini had his pieces in place and City were able to be part of the Falcao conversation without feeling the need to become more seriously involved, the deal pushed in their direction rather than the other way around.
Manchester United produced the most eye-catching piece of business as news broke early on transfer deadline day that they were signing Falcao.
The Colombian striker, who missed the World Cup with a serious knee injury, had been touted around many clubs and linked with Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City.
No-one can doubt Falcao's quality or pedigree - the main questions surrounding the deal are whether he is what United need and how manager Louis van Gaal will utilise him.
With the presence of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney, as well as British record £59.7m signing Angel Di Maria, Juan Mata and youngster Adnan Januzaj, Van Gaal has an embarrassment of riches that enabled United to sanction the sale of Welbeck to rivals Arsenal.
However, they have looked short of strength and numbers in central defence and central midfield. Have they put the roof on the house while the foundations remain in need of serious attention?
Van Gaal will be hoping Marcos Rojo's work permit issues are swiftly resolved to bolster United's defence, while AS Roma's Kevin Strootman will be a January target.
One solution may well be to drop Rooney into a deeper role and use Falcao and Van Persie as his main strikers. A nice problem to solve - but other problems may not be quite as palatable for Van Gaal.
Liverpool have been major players in the transfer window as manager Brendan Rodgers revamped his squad with the £75m he received from Barcelona for Luis Suarez.
Plenty of attention will be centred on Mario Balotelli after his shock £16m arrival from AC Milan and the early signs were good as he worked hard and well alongside Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge in the 3-0 win at Tottenham. Caution required though - Mario nearly always starts well before the rot sets in.
Rodgers has brought in nine players to flesh out the squad that performed so well to finish second in the Premier League last season and the likes of Dejan Lovren and Alberto Moreno, along with Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic, will be important figures.
Spurs had trouble getting an influx of new players to adjust following the £86m sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid last summer - Rodgers will introduce his new faces more carefully and hope for greater success.
Southampton fell prey to rival clubs this summer with manager Mauricio Pochettino moving to Spurs and the likes of Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Calum Chambers lured away.
All eyes were on new manager Ronald Koeman but there has been a strong response on the pitch with an unfortunate opening weekend loss at Liverpool and a fine win at West Ham United.
Off the pitch Koeman has been backed with much of the money Saints brought in, with the £10m signing of Senegal forward Sadio Mane from Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg on Monday taking spending to around £75m.
There was much pessimism associated with St Mary's as the exodus went on - but the early signs are good that Southampton can move into the new era with confidence.

Hull City's transfer deadline day activity was proof of how far manager Steve Bruce has brought the club in a short space of time.
Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez arrived from Palermo in a club record £10m deal while the arrivals of Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle United and Gaston Ramirez from Southampton will capture the imagination. Mo Diame's arrival from West Ham United will beef up midfield.
Bruce did a superb job in establishing Hull in the Premier League last season, as well as reaching the FA Cup final, and these deals signpost the new ambition and hope under Bruce, who has a history of being able to persuade big-name players to come to his clubs.","Manchester United's loan deal for Radamel Falcao will capture the headlines - but there were other vital issues to emerge as a hectic 24 hours came to a conclusion. Here are three key talking points:

1. The Deadline Day drama: Manchester United's loan deal for Radamel Falcao stole the headlines on Deadline Day. The Colombian striker's arrival from Monaco on a season-long loan is a major coup for United, as they look to bolster their attacking options following the departure of Robin van Persie and the injury to Wayne Rooney. Falcao's arrival adds another dimension to United's attack and will undoubtedly excite the fans.

2. Defensive reinforcements: Alongside the Falcao deal, Manchester United also strengthened their defense with the signings of Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo. Blind, who can play as a left-back or defensive midfielder, arrived from Ajax for a reported fee of around £14 million. Rojo, an Argentina international, joined United from Sporting Lisbon for a fee believed to be in the region of £16 million. These signings address United's defensive issues and provide manager Louis van Gaal with more options at the back.

3. Departures from Old Trafford: As well as new arrivals, there were also departures from Old Trafford on Deadline Day. The most notable of these was the loan move of striker Danny Welbeck to Arsenal. Welbeck, a product of United's youth system, joined the Gunners in a deal reported to be worth £16 million. This move came as a surprise to many, as Welbeck was considered a promising young talent at United. Additionally, midfielder Tom Cleverley joined Aston Villa on loan for the season, while Javier Hernandez was loaned out to Real Madrid. These departures indicate that van Gaal is keen to trim down his squad and rebuild it to his liking."
"Those sorts of events are among my favourite ways to spend time and they are a complete break from Formula 1, so a great way to refresh myself mentally before the next race.
I flew into Paris on Monday but got caught up in the French air strike and they wouldn't let us land for a while, and then there was really bad traffic so I got to the Stella McCartney show just as it was finishing, unfortunately.
There was some nonsense I saw reported somewhere about me and my friend Janelle Monae, the singer, being refused entry. But that wasn't the case at all - we were just at the wrong door, so we had to go around the back, where we saw Stella.
She's a big racing fan, and I'm a big admirer of her work, so I spent some time with her - and also with her husband Alasdhair Willis, whose clothes I buy a lot of. It was good to see them again.
I spent the next few days taking in a few of the top shows such as Valentino and the Chanel show, which was just unbelievable - I got to meet Karl Lagerfeld, who is 'The Man' when it comes to fashion. He was a really nice guy.
Fashion weeks generally are just a really super-fun time.
You get to meet the designers and get a real insight into how they came up with the clothes. And everyone is there and you bump into a lot of people in the business - I got to see Kanye (West) for example; I met Mario Testino, the great photographer, for the first time; and I got to hang with Miguel after his performance at the US Ambassador's Residence.
It's basically the best social week ever. There is a lot of relationship-building and a lot of positive things come from those weeks.
This week, I have a front cover of an incredible fashion magazine coming out, for example, which is a great way of extending my story to people who perhaps don't know so much about me.
As always, F1 is paramount and, now Paris is over, I'm fully focused on Sochi and hopefully having another successful weekend.
In fact, it could be a particularly important race for my Mercedes team because we could clinch our second consecutive constructors' championship if things go well.
We need to score three more points than Ferrari in Russia and we've done it, and it would be no less than the team deserve because they have been absolutely fantastic this year. If it happens, it will be at the same point in the season as last year.
It says a lot about the team that they are in this position despite our main rival being closer this year than last season.
We have definitely felt the heat from Ferrari at times but in terms of results Mercedes have been even more dominant.
The car has taken a step up and reliability has definitely been better and it is all down to great teamwork from everyone at our factory in Brackley, in Brixworth, and of course at Mercedes HQ in Stuttgart.
To go away from an exceptional year in 2014 and come back and have an even more successful year in 2015 is an outstanding achievement and really shows how much strength in depth we have.
I am incredibly proud of this team. In life, we tend to take things for granted - and I am as guilty of that as anyone else - but there are something like 1,200 people in this team and I take the responsibility of being part of the group that comes together on a race weekend to execute what they have worked for very seriously.
It might look easy to people watching from the outside but it is impossible to overstate just how much hard work goes into what we do.
There were times when I was at McLaren, when things were not going well, when I wondered whether that was the way it was always going to be for me in F1.
It was a big step for me to leave and join this team and things have really come together for me. I feel incredibly grateful and blessed to be in this position.
We come to Russia after the last race in Japan - and it would be hard to imagine two more contrasting tracks.
The track here in Sochi is very flat, and a massive contrast to Suzuka, which is a real racing circuit, with elevation change, sweeping corners and so on.
I like that there is a variety of circuits in F1, old and new, but I often wonder why we only have one designer of tracks.
Sometimes I think when I retire I will start designing tracks myself and give Hermann Tilke some competition - I've raced and I know what drivers like in circuits.
I feel that quite often the new generation of tracks don't grasp the true essence of F1. I know there are restrictions to do with safety and so on but the circuits often feel too calculated.
I don't know how calculated Suzuka was but it feels like they found a great spot and went with the flow of the land. That makes a real difference.
Too many of the new tracks have too little character. There are exceptions - Abu Dhabi, for example, and Austin - but this one does not stand out so much.
But the area we are in - on the coast of the Black Sea, with mountains nearby - is absolutely stunning.

"Shaesta Waiz, 29, is the first female certified civilian pilot from Afghanistan and aims to be the youngest woman to fly solo around the world.
She started her epic flight in a small, single-engine plane from the US where she now lives and recently arrived in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Ms Waiz told reporters she was excited to be back in the country of her birth.
""It's been almost 29 years. To come back to the country as a pilot who is flying around the world to inspire others - it makes me really happy to be here,"" she said.
Ms Waiz was born in a refugee camp and travelled from Afghanistan to the US in 1987 with her parents and five sisters to escape the Soviet-Afghan war.
She grew up in an underprivileged area of Richmond, California, and said it wasn't until she discovered aviation that she started thinking about going to college and having a career.
""When I was a little girl I thought maybe I would go to college, but I would get married at a young age and have a family. But then I found something that I really loved and that's flying,"" she told a news conference in Kabul.
""It's an incredible feeling to be the pilot of your own aeroplane and to fly wherever your heart desires. It's a passion that I really enjoy, that I protect, and that I want women from Afghanistan to experience as well.""
She founded a non-profit organisation called Dreams Soar and wants her flight around the world to help inspire girls and young women to pursue science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education.
Ms Waiz is the first person in her family to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree.
She says her message is that you can come ""from any background, you can have any set of challenges but what's really important is that you have to dream, to dream big and work hard and go after it"".
Ms Waiz began her journey in Florida on 13 May and is visiting 19 countries in her Beechcraft Bonanza A36 plane. After leaving Afghanistan she will fly on through Asia and Australia before crossing the US back to Florida.
She says she already has plans to return to Afghanistan.
""In a couple of years I have every intention of coming back here and maybe opening a flight school or doing something so that women can experience aviation in Afghanistan,"" she said.
""Women are suffering here a lot,"" she added. ""I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be educated, to find something that I love which is flying and it breaks my heart because I know there are a lot of girls my age who haven't had the opportunities.
""I want to do something to give back to these women.""","Shaesta Waiz, 29, is the first female certified civilian pilot from Afghanistan and aims to be the youngest woman to fly solo around the world. She started her epic flight in May 2017, embarking on a journey that would take her to 22 countries over the span of five months. 

Waiz was born in a refugee camp in Afghanistan and raised in the United States. Growing up, she had a passion for flying and held a dream of becoming a pilot. Despite facing financial challenges and cultural barriers, she persevered and earned her pilot's license in 2016.

Determined to inspire and empower young women around the world, Waiz decided to undertake a historic solo flight around the globe. She aimed to promote STEM education and encourage girls to pursue their dreams, breaking the stereotypes and expectations placed upon them.

During her journey, Waiz faced numerous challenges. She encountered extreme weather conditions, navigational obstacles, and bureaucratic hurdles in obtaining the necessary permissions to fly over certain countries. However, she overcame each obstacle with determination and resilience.

Throughout her flight, Waiz made stops in various countries, meeting with women's organizations, schools, and government officials to promote her message of empowerment. She shared her story and encouraged young girls to pursue careers in aviation and other male-dominated fields.

By the time she completed her journey in October 2017, Waiz had not only become the youngest woman to fly solo around the world, but she had also left a lasting impact on communities worldwide. She continues to advocate for gender equality in aviation and remains an inspiration for aspiring female pilots.

Shaesta Waiz's incredible journey symbolizes the power of determination, resilience, and the ability to break down barriers. Her legacy serves as a reminder that dreams can be achieved, regardless of one's background or circumstances."
"Sutherland starred as counter-terrorism agent Jack Bauer in the highly-successful thriller from 2001 to 2010, and made a return in last year's spin-off series 24: Live Another Day.
When Fox announced a reboot with a new protagonist earlier this year, the star said he hadn't ""ruled out a cameo.""
However, he has now told the BBC: ""24 is definitely over now for me.""
""It's one of the greatest gifts I've ever been given as an actor,"" Sutherland added, ""but it's moving on without me, I want to do other things.""
The Canadian star, who made his name in 1980s ""Brat Pack"" films like The Lost Boys and Young Guns, said working in television had fundamentally changed his outlook on acting.
""I want to do more television,"" he said. ""My experience of 24 was unbelievable, but the main benefit was that it was nice to do something that people actually watched, and that they enjoyed.
""There are some movies I've made people might have enjoyed, but there were nine of them watching. And so 24 was so refreshing - the most significant thing was that it was accessible to a lot of people and to know they enjoyed it was so rewarding for me.
""I don't think there's a better medium than television out there at the moment. So think I want to do more of it and look for projects where I can repeat my experience.
""You have to take your time though to find something like it - and that means you have to work less. So I'll be waiting for something that's worth it, with the potential for the kind of audience access that 24 had.""
Despite this, Sutherland was speaking to the BBC at the launch of his new film, Forsaken, which sees the 48-year-old star opposite his father Donald for the first time.
The younger Sutherland explains that he ""dreamed for thirty years of acting opposite my father, but I just wanted this ideal project to come along.
""Then at Christmas I just looked at my father and I realized we probably didn't have that much time left to do this together - he's just turned 80 - so I got on with it.""
Forsaken is Sutherland's first western since Young Guns 2 in 1990. He plays a reformed killer, while Donald plays his estranged father.
The star believes that it was only the kudos of the actors' names that allowed the film to get a green light.
""Hollywood doesn't want to make westerns any more,"" he mourns. ""I've had Robert Downey Jr and Kevin Bacon both express envy because I'd been able to make Young Guns at all.
""The studios may have tried to make a western with aliens, anything to try and revive the genre, but generally it's not on the cards.
""New York and Los Angeles are where ideas for films come from and they've long since left the middle of the country behind, they don't represent it very well.""
Forsaken has shown at the Toronto and Zurich Film Festivals, and has been bought for cinema release next year. But Sutherland says that, for once, the success of the film is secondary to his experience.
""I was so desperately afraid that I would let my father down,"" he confesses. ""But it turned out he was as nervous as I was, and we told each other that the night before we started shooting.
""It turned out great, I think - perhaps it's cheating, but when I looked into my real father's eyes during takes I think my heart beats a little faster.
""Some fathers take their sons fishing to connect - I got to make a movie with my dad, even if it was a little late in life.""
The Zurich Film Festival runs from 24 September - 4 October.","Sutherland starred as counter-terrorism agent Jack Bauer in the highly-successful thriller from 2001 to 2010, and made a return in last year's spin-off series 24: Live Another Day.

However, it was later revealed that the actor would not be returning as Jack Bauer in the new iteration of the show titled 24: Legacy. While fans were disappointed, Sutherland expressed his support for the new series and stated that he felt it was time for someone else to take on the role. 24: Legacy premiered in February 2017 with Corey Hawkins as the new lead character, and although it received mixed reviews, it garnered a dedicated fan base."

The other Hampden semi-final, Rangers v Celtic, is at 14:15 on 23 October.
In previous seasons, a number of League Cup semi-finals have been played in Edinburgh, with both Hibernian's Easter Road and Hearts' Tynecastle hosting the ties.
Bus journeys from Aberdeen to Glasgow can take up to three hours.

""It is from an attendance perspective very regrettable that the game kicks off at 12.15pm, which is a major disadvantage to our fantastic travelling support in particular for games such as these.
""Regarding the choice of venue we understand and accept that it is for all clubs to indicate the crowd they anticipate taking and Hampden Park was chosen on this basis.
""We accept that the majority of our supporters would have had to travel for at least a couple of hours to attend this fixture at any suitable venue, but are disappointed as we feel that this outcome has a very negative impact on what should be a great day out and experience for all supporters.""","The Dons face Championship Morton at the national stadium in Glasgow on Saturday 22 October. And the Premiership club believe their support will be at a ""major disadvantage"" because of the location of the match. Playing at the national stadium in Glasgow means that the majority of the crowd is likely to be made up of fans from Morton, who are based in the Glasgow area. This gives them a home advantage as they will have a larger and more vocal support.

The Dons, who are from Aberdeen, will have to travel a considerable distance to reach the stadium, and they are concerned that their fans may not be able to make the trip in such large numbers. This could lead to a lack of support and a less vibrant atmosphere compared to what Morton will have.

Additionally, the familiarity with the surroundings and the pitch at the national stadium may also work in favor of Morton. They are likely to have played there more frequently and therefore may have a better understanding of the stadium and its unique characteristics.

Overall, the Dons believe that the location of the match puts them at a major disadvantage in terms of support and familiarity with the surroundings. However, they will still aim to give their best on the pitch and overcome these obstacles."

"The impromptu surgery was done in the open air by a family member with razorblades outside the maternity ward of Douala's Laquintini Hospital, because medical staff refused to help.
One of the babies was dead, but witnesses said the second baby was still alive when it was removed, though it died shortly afterwards.
As the hospital staff refused to help, this has not been corroborated by medical officials.
Marie Sen, Ms Koumateke's mother:
""The mortuary attendant even came and said the babies were still kicking inside the stomach""
About an hour earlier, Monique Koumateke, 31, was nearly full term when her family rushed her to hospital in a taxi after she had become ill.
The midwife on duty told her relatives she was already dead and should be taken to the mortuary.
Then an attendant, Monga Luc, noticed the twins might still be alive.
""The mortuary attendant even came and said the babies were still kicking inside the stomach,"" her mother Marie Sen told the BBC.
""We went to the maternity ward [again] but they chased us away.""
However, when they went back to the main hospital, they were told no-one would help.
This is when a relative of Ms Koumateke's partner, Takeh Rose, rushed to find some razorblades to see if she could rescue the twins.
Onlookers at the hospital two weeks ago filmed the scene and the footage was shared on social media.
In the subsequent uproar, police arrested the midwife and nurse on duty that day, as well as Ms Rose and the mortuary attendant. All four have been released on bail as investigations continue.
Hospital officials have not commented, but Health Minister Andre Mama Fouda, speaking after the arrests, said the staff at the state-run institution had done nothing wrong.
A Supreme Court judge has also become involved in the heated debate about the issue online.
Justice Ayah Paul Abine posted on Facebook that the minister's exoneration of the hospital staff needed to be investigated.
Protesters in Douala have been calling for Mr Fouda to resign.
""Hospitals now are just money-making businesses,"" one resident told me.
Cameroonians do not receive free health care and have to pay for consultations as well as medicine, which can be costly.
It is not uncommon for people to be detained at hospitals until their bills are paid.
According to the UN, 28% of Cameroon's population live below the income poverty line.
The recent death of a pregnant medical doctor in Douala caused similar outrage.
Dr Helene Ngo Kana had an ectopic pregnancy and was unable to pay for medical assistance - and so died in Douala's General Hospital without getting any help.
""This is a regime of shame. You have to pay before they deliver you; pay before you are treated,"" said opposition leader John Fru Ndi, condemning the poor treatment of patients at state-run hospitals.
He made the comments after visiting the Koumateke family at their run-down house in Douala's Mboppi slum. Ms Koumateke leaves behind her partner and two children aged three and five.
More than a dozen lawyers have now clubbed together to fight for justice for those who came to Ms Koumateke's aid.
They are offering their services free of charge to help win compensation for Ms Koumateke's children and her partner, as well as defending Ms Rose and the mortuary attendant.
""We are first of all humans, then lawyers. This sad incident could not leave anyone indifferent,"" said attorney Guy Olivier Moutin.
""It's a fight for the widower and the two children left behind. And we will defend two of the four arrested… we will fight for their total freedom.""
And civil society leaders in Doula, like Ferdinand Ndifor, are calling for a full investigation into Cameroon's health system.
""Are the hospitals equipped? Are there enough doctors on duty?"" he asked.
""We want to know - will this happen again tomorrow?""","The impromptu surgery was done in the open air by a family member with razorblades outside the maternity ward of Douala's Laquintini Hospital, because medical staff refused to help. One can only imagine the desperation and fear that this family must have been experiencing to resort to such extreme measures. It is truly heartbreaking that they were denied help by the medical staff, who are supposed to prioritize the well-being and safety of their patients.

While the specific reasons for the medical staff's refusal are not mentioned, it highlights a serious issue within the healthcare system. It is essential for medical professionals to provide assistance and care to those in need, regardless of the circumstances. Denying such care not only goes against their ethical obligations but also puts lives at risk.

The fact that an impromptu surgery was performed with razorblades is alarming and raises concerns about proper sterilization and the potential risks of infection. In such situations, it is imperative that healthcare facilities provide accessible and immediate help, ensuring the well-being and safety of patients and their families.

This incident also sheds light on the need for improved healthcare infrastructure and resources, as well as increased awareness and education about emergency medical situations. Access to proper medical facilities and trained professionals should be a basic right for everyone, and incidents like these highlight the gaps and failures within the healthcare system.

It is important for authorities, medical professionals, and policymakers to take note of this incident and work towards implementing measures that ensure timely and appropriate medical care for all individuals in need. No one should ever have to face the agonizing choice of resorting to improvised surgeries due to a lack of assistance from healthcare professionals."

The 76-year-old Argentine has described inequality as ""a social sin that cries out to Heaven"" - and has emphasised the Church's duty to serve the poor and disenfranchised.
He is known for modernising a previously conservative Argentine Church, while Benedict XVI served as Catholicism's doctrinal watchdog for more than two decades before he was elected Pope.
Cardinal Bergoglio certainly preferred life in the local Church to the bureaucracy of Rome's administrative body - the Curia, which is widely perceived as plagued with management issues and in need of reform.
Pope Francis is also the first Jesuit Pope - from an ancient and fiercely independent Catholic order that has not always enjoyed the best relationship with Rome.
However, he has worked on various Curial committees, as a member of the Congregation of Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments and the Congregation for the Clergy among others.
He is a fluent speaker of Italian - as well as German and Spanish - so will have no problems communicating with the team around him.
Having Italian roots - both his parents were Italian - will be seen as a plus in a very Roman institution.
The new Pope is a theological conservative and those looking for a change in the Church's stance on abortion, same-sex marriage, and contraception will be disappointed. He is staunchly orthodox on issues of sexual morality.
These qualities made him a strong contender for the papacy in 2005, when he was reportedly the chief rival to Joseph Ratzinger.
Pope Francis is also said to have warm relations with the Jewish community in Buenos Aires, receiving awards from Jewish organisations, which strengthen his interfaith credentials.
He is a keen evangelist, criticising what he has called ""the spiritual sickness of a self-referential Church"" - and calling for the Church to ""get out into the street"".
Seen as in touch with the modern world, he has already invited journalists, some 5,600 of whom are in Rome to cover his election, to an audience on Saturday.
These skills will be needed as he tries to stem the flow of Catholics from the pews both in an increasingly secular Europe and a Latin America where Pentecostal churches are thriving.
He assumes the papacy at a time when religious intolerance is growing and will be tasked with shoring up confidence in an institution that has been rocked by the sexual abuse of minors by priests.
And the man who has to confront these challenges is a 76-year-old who has lived for decades with just one lung, having suffered a respiratory disease in his youth.
On Wednesday night he made an assured, if understated, start as he greeted the faithful from the St Peter's Basilica balcony.
Perhaps what summed up the encounter best was the new Pope's humility.
""Only someone who has encountered mercy, who has been caressed by the tenderness of mercy, is happy and comfortable with the Lord,"" he said in 2001.
It was characteristic that when he greeted his flock for the first time, Pope Francis blessed them, but only after he had asked them to pray with him - and for him.","Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio had a reputation as a humble pastor who even in high office commuted to work by bus, lived in an apartment rather than an apostolic palace and cooked his own meals. When he was elected as Pope in 2013, he took the name Pope Francis and continued to showcase his humility and simplicity. Instead of moving into the luxurious papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace, he chose to reside in the more modest Vatican guesthouse, where he could live a simpler and more accessible life. 

Pope Francis made it clear from the beginning of his papacy that he wanted to be a Pope for the people, showing solidarity with the poor, marginalized, and oppressed. He emphasized the importance of caring for the environment and addressing issues of social justice. His commitment to simplicity and humility has helped to enhance his reputation as a true servant leader.

In addition to his personal lifestyle choices, Pope Francis has taken numerous steps to reform the Vatican hierarchy, combat corruption, and increase transparency in the Church. He has shown a willingness to challenge traditional practices and shake up established systems, making him a figure of controversy within some circles, but also garnering praise for his efforts to bring about positive change.

Overall, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio's reputation as a humble pastor has remained intact even after assuming the highest office in the Catholic Church. His actions and emphasis on humility, simplicity, and serving others have made him a beloved figure to many Catholics and non-Catholics alike."

Reporting by Menaka Rao","The 12 men were accused of waging war against the nation, conspiracy and murder. One man was acquitted. The serial bombings on 11 July 2006 killed 189 people and injured over 700 others in multiple locations across the country. The accused men were allegedly part of a terrorist organization that planned and executed the attacks. The bombings caused widespread panic and fear among the population.

During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence linking the accused men to the bombings, including surveillance footage, witness testimonies, and the recovery of explosives and weapons. The defendants, however, maintained their innocence throughout the trial and claimed that they were unfairly targeted due to their religious beliefs.

After a lengthy and highly publicized trial, the verdict was delivered. Eleven of the accused men were found guilty on charges of waging war against the nation, conspiracy, and murder. They were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The twelfth man, however, was acquitted due to insufficient evidence linking him to the crimes.

The verdict sparked mixed reactions among the public. Many celebrated the conviction of the guilty men, hoping it would bring justice to the victims and deter future acts of terrorism. Others questioned the fairness of the trial and raised concerns about the potential for wrongful conviction.

The bombings and subsequent trial had a lasting impact on the nation. Security measures were heightened, and there was increased awareness and vigilance regarding terrorism threats. The incident also prompted discussions about religious extremism, the need for better intelligence gathering, and efforts to counter radicalization.

The memory of the bombings and the lives lost continue to haunt the nation. Each year, on the anniversary of the attack, memorial services are held to honor the victims and remind the public of the importance of unity against extremist ideologies."

"David Cottrell, 90, from Redland, was honoured for his part in saving the lives of more than 70 Norwegians on a sinking ship in June 1944.
He was just 19 when the crew of HMS Swift ignored orders and rescued the men from the water, after their ship, the Svenner, was torpedoed.
Mr Cottrell told BBC Points West: ""It's a proud moment.""
He was an Able Seaman Gunner on HMS Swift, which narrowly missed being hit by the torpedoes before they were used to sink the nearby Norwegian destroyer Svenner, off Sword Beach, Normandy, on 6 June 1944.
Mr Cottrell said the ship ""broke in half and sank almost immediately. People were jumping over the sides.""
HMS Swift's captain John Gower disobeyed orders to leave the men and instead went to pick up survivors. Of 219 crew aboard the Svenner, 32 Norwegians and one Briton died.
Mr Cottrell said in 2001 he met two of the Norwegians who had been on the Svenner and one of them told him and Captain Gower: ""What you've done, myself, my children, my grandchildren owe you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid.""
Nigel Fletcher, Norwegian consul for the South West, said Mr Cottrell had been put forward for the Commemorative Medal after meeting a survivor of the Svenner at a memorial service to mark the 70th anniversary in Norway in 2014.
""It's a great recognition and I think also it gives him time to reflect on his old shipmates and the other people who were with him on that day.""
Mr Cottrell's son Richard said he was very proud of his father: ""It's one story among thousands and they are all remarkable.""","David Cottrell, 90, from Redland, was honoured for his part in saving the lives of more than 70 Norwegians on a sinking ship in June 1944. He was just 19 years old at the time. The ship was a supply vessel that was hit by a German torpedo during World War II.

Cottrell was serving as a radio operator on a British naval vessel when they received a distress call from the sinking ship. Without hesitation, Cottrell and his crewmates sprang into action, determined to rescue as many people as possible.

Braving treacherous waters and enemy fire, Cottrell and his team managed to pull dozens of survivors from the frigid sea. In the face of great danger, their bravery and dedication to saving lives shone through.

For his heroic actions, Cottrell was awarded the British Empire Medal, an honor bestowed upon individuals who have made significant contributions to their country in various fields, including acts of bravery. The medal serves as a testament to his courage and selflessness during a time of war.

Despite the passage of time, Cottrell's acts of heroism have not been forgotten. The Norwegian government recently recognized him for his role in saving the lives of their citizens, presenting him with a commemorative plaque to express their gratitude.

Today, David Cottrell continues to inspire others with his incredible story of bravery and resilience. He serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless individuals during World War II and the lasting impact they had on the lives of others."
"In the eight-hour exercise, actors in various parts of the UK are simulating symptoms to test the responses of emergency services and the government.
Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people worldwide, and a UN expert has said the world will live with it ""forever"" unless global action stops the virus.
Passenger screening is to be introduced at key UK airports and rail terminals.
Similar measures are being taken in the US, with screening under way at New York's JFK airport and checks at some other airports due to start in the coming days.
As part of the UK effort to help contain the outbreak, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a medical ship, is being loaded with supplies in Falmouth ahead of a mission to Sierra Leone.
Meanwhile, Macedonian officials have said test results have proved a British man suspected to have died of Ebola did not have the virus.
The national exercise, ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron, is expected to include a simulated meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, to be chaired by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
Some hospital staff were expected to wear personal protective equipment during the exercise.
A Department of Health spokesman said officials had been planning the response to an Ebola case in the UK for ""many months"".
""It is vital that we test these plans in as realistic a situation as possible - with real people,"" the spokesman said.
Figures from the World Health Organization show there have been 4,024 confirmed or suspected Ebola deaths in the worst-affected West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone during the current outbreak.
In total, there have been 8,399 confirmed or suspected cases, mostly in West Africa.
Dr David Nabarro, UN special envoy on Ebola, said ""just about every country in the world"", and many non-governmental organisations, needed to support afflicted countries, otherwise it would be ""impossible"" to get the virus quickly under control.
If this was not done, he said, the world ""will have to live with the Ebola virus forever"".
""This is a real challenge to all of us that's going to require every piece of ingenuity and collective action that we can mount,"" he told the UN.
Dr Nabarro said in many of the West African communities affected, the day of death was one of important rituals which, if not observed, undermined ""the very fabric of society"".
""Yet people who are dying of Ebola are very dangerous and if they're touched and if they're held at that moment of death they can infect large numbers of other people,"" he said.
The government this week said people arriving from areas hit by Ebola would face ""enhanced screening"" at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as at Eurostar terminals.
Ministers initially said there were no plans to screen people arriving from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
However, a Downing Street spokesman said the decision to introduce Ebola screening had been based on advice from the Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies.
Ebola symptoms: What to do in the UK
Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding - but these are similar to more common infections like flu and some stomach bugs.
If you have these symptoms and have had contact with an Ebola patient, ring 111 first. Do not go directly to A&E or a GP.
If there has been no contact with Ebola, seek help from 111, your GP or A&E if necessary.
The chances of developing Ebola in the UK are low.
Passengers will be asked questions and potentially given a medical assessment during the screening process, Downing Street said.
The Department of Health said further details about how passengers will be checked will be announced next week before the measures come into effect.
In a statement it said ""government departments, health protection agencies and the transport sector are continuing to work closely together to minimise the risk"" of the virus.
""It is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases but the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low,"" the statement said.
Mr Cameron said it was right to take action ""to keep our own people safe"" from Ebola.
""What we do is we listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice and that's why we're introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports,"" he said.
Mr Cameron said the government was focussed on taking action ""right across the board to deal with this problem at source"".
""We're making a bigger contribution than almost any other country, in West Africa, to help deal with the crisis at its source,"" he said.
However, David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the screening was a ""complete waste of time"".
There are currently no direct flights to the UK from the affected areas, but people can fly via Paris or Brussels.
""Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? That would lead to a lot of delays and disruption,"" he said.
More than 750 military personnel and RFA Argus are being sent to West Africa to help in efforts to contain the outbreak.
RFA Argus, which has a fully equipped hospital including critical care and high-dependency units, will leave for Sierra Leone next week.
It will travel with three Merlin helicopters, aircrew and engineers to provide transport and support to medical teams and aid workers.
Personnel from the Army's 22 Field Hospital have been training in York and are expected to be sent to west Africa in the coming weeks to run a 12-bed facility specifically to treat medics who have caught Ebola.

The cap forms part of a protective hood covering the head and neck. It offers medical workers an added layer of protection, ensuring that they cannot touch any part of their face whilst in the treatment centre.
Goggles, or eye visors, are used to provide cover to the eyes, protecting them from splashes. The goggles are sprayed with an anti-fogging solution before being worn. On October 21, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  announced stringent new guidelines for healthcare personnel who may be dealing with Ebola patients. In the new guidelines, health workers are advised to use a single use disposable full face shield as goggles may not provide complete skin coverage.
Covers the mouth to protect from sprays of blood or body fluids from patients. When wearing a respirator, the medical worker must  tear this outer mask to allow the respirator through.
A respirator is worn to protect the wearer from a patient's coughs. According to guidelines from the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the respirator should be put on second, right after donning the overalls.
A surgical scrub suit, durable hospital clothing that absorbs liquid and is  easily cleaned, is worn as a baselayer underneath the overalls. It is normally tucked into rubber boots to ensure no skin is exposed.
The overalls are placed on top of the scrubs. These suits are similar to hazardous material (hazmat) suits worn in toxic environments. The team member supervising the process should check that the equipment is not damaged.
A minimum two sets of gloves are required, covering the suit cuff. When putting on the gloves, care must be taken to ensure that no skin is exposed and that they are worn in such a way that any fluid on the sleeve will run off the suit and glove. Medical workers must change gloves between patients, performing thorough hand hygiene before donning a new pair. Heavy duty gloves are used whenever workers need to handle infectious waste.
A waterproof apron is placed on top of the overalls as a final layer of protective clothing.
Ebola health workers typically wear rubber boots, with the scrubs tucked into the footwear. If boots are unavailable, workers must wear closed, puncture and fluid-resistant shoes.","In the eight-hour exercise, actors in various parts of the UK are simulating symptoms to test the responses of emergency services and the government. Ebola has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa since the outbreak in 2014. It is a highly contagious and deadly virus, and its rapid spread is a great concern for global health security. To ensure that the UK is well-prepared to handle any potential outbreak, the eight-hour exercise aims to test the emergency services and government's response in managing a simulated Ebola crisis.

Throughout the exercise, actors will simulate different symptoms of Ebola, allowing emergency services to practice identifying and responding to potential cases. The exercise will evaluate the capability of emergency services, healthcare providers, and the government in quickly identifying and containing the virus, as well as coordinating an effective response.

This simulation exercise is crucial in identifying any gaps in the response system and improving preparedness measures. It allows the different agencies involved to test their communication, coordination, and decision-making processes, ensuring that they can swiftly and efficiently respond to a real outbreak if it were to occur.

The exercise will also provide an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of existing protocols and procedures, such as patient isolation and management, contact tracing, and the provision of personal protective equipment. Lessons learned from this exercise will aid in refining and enhancing existing response plans and strategies.

By simulating a realistic outbreak scenario, the UK can assess its readiness and identify areas for improvement to protect public health in case of an actual Ebola outbreak. This exercise demonstrates the UK's commitment to preparedness and ensuring that the necessary measures are in place to respond effectively to emerging health threats."

"According to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their attention on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign chair Paul Manafort, among others.
As it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son.
The president, Trump Jr and his administration have quickly reformed their defences and are now dismissing the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last June as a minor event during a hurly-burly political season, largely lost in the fog of time, that led to nothing and which they have been admirably ""transparent"" in discussing.
Key members of Congress seem to think otherwise, with senators like Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling for Trump Jr to be questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa eager to bring Manafort before his Senate Judiciary Committee.
But while Congress gears up for more hearings, Mr Mueller operates quietly behind the scenes. Where might he look first? What threads, revealed in Trump Jr's emails, will he and his team tug on, to see what unravels?
Here are a few of the tempting questions he might be tempted to ask.
Nestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the ""official documents and information"" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just ""part of"" Russia's support for his father, ""helped along by Aras and Emin"" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo.
It's a rather stunning detail for Goldstone to have offhandedly mentioned - and one that Trump Jr, in his ""love it"" response, seems to have breezed past with no comment.
That kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: ""What's the rest of the story?""
Why is this British guy emailing Trump Jr?
Even if one takes Veselnitskaya at her word that she is not an agent of the Russian government and did not know or provide any damaging information about Mrs Clinton to the Trump team during the 9 June meeting, her own recent admissions raise some pressing questions.
On Tuesday she told an NBC interviewer that Trump Jr, Manafort and Kushner may have been ""longing for"" the dirt on their Democratic opponent.
""They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,"" she said.
In other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer.
Given that Veselnitskaya is at the very least a well-connected figure in Moscow, it doesn't require a great leap of faith to think this information eventually made its way to the Russian government. If the US intelligence community is to be believed, that government soon would acquire a trove of damaging information about Mrs Clinton and the Democrats as a result of hacks it co-ordinated into the Democratic National Committee server and the personal email of a senior member of Mrs Clinton's campaign team.
In the ensuing months, details from those hacks would be made public via Wikileaks at times that were particularly damaging to Mrs Clinton.
Derogatory statements about Mrs Clinton's Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders were produced the week before Democrats gathered for their national convention. Transcripts of Mrs Clinton's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs were published just days before the final presidential debate - and cited during that showdown by Mr Trump himself.
The Trump campaign wanted dirt on Mrs Clinton. The Russian government had it in spades. Mr Mueller might want to see if those dots can be connected.
Another choice tidbit in that first Goldstone email was his suggestion that he might ""send this info to your father via Rhona"" - a reference to Rhona Graff, the elder Trump's personal assistant.
Graff has served as the gatekeeper to Mr Trump at the Trump organisation - and, according to a profile in Politico, still is the preferred method for the president's business associates to contact him outside of White House channels.
""If I really wanted to whisper something in his ear, I would probably go to Rhona,"" Trump business associate John Catsimatidis told the publication.
The White House has said that Mr Trump did not know about the meeting with Veselnitskaya - despite the fact that his son, son-in-law and campaign chief were in attendance and it took place in his New York tower.
If this assertion is proven to be inaccurate, Rhona could be the key.
Trump Jr meeting scandal: The key players
The middle portion of the email chain released on Tuesday morning involved Trump Jr and Goldstone trying to set up a phone conversation with Russian pop star/businessman Emin Agalarov.
After a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the ""Russian government attorney"" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week.
Mr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering.
And what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign?
Did Donald Trump Jr break the law?
Four days after the first email from Goldstone to Trump Jr about the incriminating information the Russia government was said to have about Mrs Clinton, candidate Trump promised to give a ""major speech"" the following week discussing ""all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons"", including Mrs Clinton's alleged misdeeds while serving as secretary of state.
""I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,"" he added.
That speech, originally announced for the Monday after the Trump camp's New York meeting with Veselnitskaya, never took place.
Was this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton?
That's one more question Mr Mueller might be mulling.
Follow Anthony Zurcher on Twitter.","According to CNN, the former FBI director and his team of crack investigators were caught somewhat flat-footed by the recent email revelations. They were believed to have been focusing their efforts on other aspects of the investigation and were not expecting the email revelations to come to light. This development seemingly caught them by surprise and caused a significant shift in their investigation.

The former FBI director, James Comey, and his team were reportedly concentrating on examining potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. They had spent months gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses for this particular aspect of the investigation.

However, the unexpected discovery of emails related to Hillary Clinton's private server, found on a laptop belonging to former congressman Anthony Weiner, caused an abrupt change in the FBI's focus. This led to the reopening of the investigation into Clinton's handling of classified information just days before the election.

It is important to note that the term ""crack investigators"" used in the question seems exaggerated, as the FBI is generally known for its skilled and trained investigators. Nonetheless, the unexpected nature of the email revelations did catch them off guard, requiring them to adjust and reallocate their resources accordingly."
"The former Rangers owner's lawyer said ""comfort"" was instead taken from the fact that Mr Whyte had ""reputable"" advisers.
The evidence emerged in the trial of Craig Whyte who is accused of a fraudulent acquisition of Rangers in 2011.
He denies a charge of fraud and another under the Companies Act.
During questioning of solicitor David Horne - a key advisor to Sir David Murray - defence QC Donald Findlay queried how much was spent appraising Mr Whyte's interest in Rangers.
The jury has already heard how Mr Whyte struck a £1 deal to buy Sir David's controlling stake at Ibrox in May 2011.
Prosecutors claim Mr Whyte helped fund the takeover with a loan from the firm Ticketus against three years worth of season ticket sales.
Sir David earlier told the trial at the High Court in Glasgow that he would ""categorically not"" have handed the club over if he had known that was how the deal was to be financed.
Donald Findlay suggested that the Murray team wanted to sell ""for the right reasons or not"" provided Rangers bank debt was cleared.
He asked Mr Horne how much was spent on ""due diligence"" of Mr Whyte before the takeover.
Mr Horne initially said ""not very much at all"".
The QC suggested: ""£20? More? Less?""
The witness responded: ""I don't know - possibly nothing.""
Mr Findlay then said: ""That was what was spent - nothing?""
Mr Horne agreed.
The advocate suggested that if proper checks had been done, they would have known ""his first piggy bank to his inside leg measurement"".
But, Mr Horne replied: ""We took comfort that he had reputable advisors.
""If anything had been thrown up that suggested any impropriety, the deal would not have gone ahead.""
Mr Findlay then claimed a ""whole range of people"" knew about Ticketus' involvement.
Mr Horne earlier told how he only learned of the ticketing firm's role after Mr Whyte's deal to buy Rangers had gone through.
The QC said that if the Murray team wanted to know ""where the money came from"" they could have carried out the due diligence.
He also claimed that all Sir David Murray eventually wanted to do was to sell Rangers to Craig Whyte, adding ""it is as simple as that"".
Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC later went on to ask Mr Horne: ""On the face of it, was Murray keen to complete the deal?""
The witness replied: ""Yes.""
Mr Prentice continued: ""Would he have sold no matter what?""
Mr Horne said: ""No.""
Prosecutors allege Mr Whyte pretended to Sir David Murray, and others, that funds were available to make all required payments to acquire a ""controlling and majority stake"" in the club.
The Crown alleges Mr Whyte had only £4m available from two sources at the time but took out a £24m loan from Ticketus against three years of future season ticket sales.
The court has heard the sale was eventually made to Mr Whyte for £1 but came with obligations to pay an £18m bank debt, a £2.8m ""small tax case"" bill, £1.7m for stadium repairs, £5m for players and £5m in working capital.
The second charge under the Companies Act centres on the £18m payment between Mr Whyte's Wavetower company and Rangers to clear a bank debt.
The trial, before Judge Lady Stacey, continues.","The former Rangers owner's lawyer said ""comfort"" was instead taken from the fact that Mr Whyte had ""reputable"" advisers. The evidence emerged in the trial of Craig Whyte who is accused of fraudulently acquiring Rangers Football Club in 2011. The lawyer argued that the use of the word ""comfort"" did not imply that Whyte had sufficient funds to meet the club's financial obligations, rather it suggested that he had reputable professionals advising him. The trial aims to determine whether Whyte deliberately misled the club's board about his resources and ability to finance the purchase."
"But Ecowas leaders meeting in Liberia said the implications of its membership still needed to be considered before Morocco could formally join.
King Mohammed VI was not at the summit because Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been invited.
Morocco's application comes after it rejoined the African Union in January.
Morocco left the continental body in 1984 after it recognised the independence of Western Sahara.
Morocco regards Western Sahara as part of its historic territory and has spent much of the last three decades trying to strengthen ties with Europe at the expense of relations with Africa.
Ivory Coast President Alasanne Ouattara has confirmed that the decision had been agreed in principle but the details still had to be worked out.
Morocco, along with Tunisia which is seeking observer status with the organisation and Mauritania, which wants to return to the body, will be invited to the next meeting of heads of state in Togo in December, a senior Ecowas source told the BBC.
Ecowas is made up of 15 West African nations, none of which shares a border with Morocco.
Members enjoy free trade and movement of people.
King Mohammed VI last week announced he would not be attending the summit in Liberia, because of the presence of Israel's prime minister.
Morocco does not have diplomatic ties with Israel.
Mr Netanyahu addressed West African leaders on Sunday saying: ""Israel is coming back to Africa and Africa is coming back to Israel.
""I believe in Africa. I believe in its potential, present and future. It is a continent on the rise.""
While in Liberia for the summit, his bodyguards scuffled with those of Togo's President Faure Gnassingbe, according to reports in the Israeli media.
This trip comes nearly a year after Mr Netanyahu was in East Africa as part of his efforts to strengthen ties between the continent and Israel.","But Ecowas leaders meeting in Liberia said the implications of its membership still needed to be considered before Morocco could formally join. King Mohammed VI was not at the summit , but was represented by his brother Prince Moulay Rachid. The leaders agreed to establish a committee to assess the potential impact of Morocco's membership on ECOWAS' institutional, legal, technical, and financial frameworks.

The decision to admit Morocco as a member was not taken lightly, as it would require significant adjustments within ECOWAS to accommodate a country outside of West Africa. Some concerns were raised regarding the potential economic and political dominance of Morocco within the organization, as well as the implications for other regional integration initiatives.

Additionally, the ongoing territorial dispute between Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), a member of the African Union, posed another challenge. Some ECOWAS member states support the SADR, and their concerns regarding Morocco's membership and its stance on the Western Sahara issue were taken into account during the discussions.

Overall, while the Ecowas leaders recognized the potential benefits of Morocco's membership, they emphasized the need to carefully consider the implications and address any challenges before formally approving its entry into the organization."

"The Microsoft-owned chat app said that the move reflected the public preference for using mobile devices to make video calls from the living room, despite the size advantage TVs offered.
It will continue to maintain the service until June.
Afterwards, it will be up to individual manufacturers to decide whether to remove the app or continue offering an unsupported service.
Skype's intention to focus its efforts on phones and tablets comes at a time when it faces heightened competition.
Although Google's rival Hangouts service has had limited appeal on mobiles, Facebook's Messenger and Apple's Facetime apps are making more headway.
In addition, Xiaomi recently launched its own Mi Video Call service, and Slack has announced plans to add support for video chats to its popular business-focused chat tool.
Skype for TV was first unveiled at the CES tech show in January 2010 and was marketed as a way to let families ""share the limelight [from their sofa] so there's no more huddling around the computer or missing an out-of-shot moment"".
It required TVs to be fitted with either a built-in camera or a plug-in peripheral.
TV-makers that adopted the service included Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Philips.
""Over the years, users have changed the way they use Skype, with the majority accessing it from a mobile device - including when in the living room,"" reads a message posted to the app's support page.
""We want to make sure we prioritise delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why we've decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible.""
Samsung has already announced that its TVs will stop offering the app from 2 June.
Many science-fiction movies and comics had envisioned that people would want to chat to each other via large screens in their homes.
But one expert said that technology had gone down a ""very different route"".
""On paper the idea of using a TV for things like Skype made a lot of sense - it's a non-threatening device that people were already comfortable with, so it seemed a good way to get the tech into the living room,"" said Chris Green, a technology analyst at the consultancy Lewis.
""But the ubiquity of mobile devices made video conferencing on TVs redundant.

"Lisa Walton bought Pirums Figaro from Shan Allman, of Colwinston, Vale of Glamorgan, for £18,000 in May 2011.
But afterwards she said the animal was ""dangerous"" and wanted her money back.
After unsuccessfully suing Mrs Allman, the High Court ordered Mrs Walton, of Doncaster, to pay the former owner's ""substantial"" legal bill.
Mrs Allman refused to take the pony back or return the cash, saying she had honestly described the pony's character before selling him.
She said he never displayed any ""vicious behaviour"" while her own young daughter, Bethan, was looking after him.
Mr Justice Snowden's ruling means Mrs Walton's farm has been effectively mortgaged to Mrs Allman who can, if she wishes, seek an order for the property's sale.
He added Mrs Allman had ""already incurred very substantial costs"" but ""Mr and Mrs Walton had not made any effort"" to pay them.
After the hearing, Mrs Allman, who released footage of her daughter Bethan riding Figaro, told BBC Wales: ""The original case that she brought against me concerning the sale of the horse was absolute nonsense and should never have gone to court in the first place.
""I made a number of offers that she turned down which I think she is probably regretting now.
""I'm absolutely relieved that the case has come to an end and I've got security against my legal bills.""","Lisa Walton bought Pirums Figaro from Shan Allman, of Colwinston, Vale of Glamorgan, for £18,000 in May 2011. But afterwards she said the animal was ""dangerous"" and wanted her money back. Lisa claimed that the horse had exhibited aggressive behavior and had injured her on multiple occasions. She believed that Shan Allman had purposely concealed the true nature of the horse from her during the sale.

Lisa filed a lawsuit against Shan, seeking a full refund of the purchase price and additional damages for the injuries she had sustained. In court, Lisa presented evidence of her injuries and testimony from witnesses who had observed the horse's aggressive behavior.

Shan, on the other hand, argued that Lisa had been fully aware of the horse's behavior and had assumed the risk when she purchased it. He also claimed that Lisa had mishandled the horse, causing the injuries herself.

The court carefully considered the evidence and witness testimonies provided by both parties. After a thorough evaluation, it was determined that the horse did indeed exhibit dangerous behavior and had caused harm to Lisa. The court ruled in Lisa's favor and ordered Shan to refund the full purchase price of £18,000, along with additional damages for the injuries suffered.

On Thursday, the company called the allegations ""inaccurate distortions"".
Exxon Mobil's vice-president for public affairs, Kenneth Cohen, said on Thursday, ""We unequivocally reject the allegations that Exxon Mobil has suppressed climate change research.""
The investigation centres on whether the company lied as recently as this year to investors about the risks of climate change raised by its own scientists.
Exxon was accused by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times of funding anti-climate change groups to mislead the public about the threat of global warming.
US presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both called for inquiries into Exxon actions.

"He told the Commons that six regional airports could be added to the Heathrow hub network, bringing the total to 14.
The new airports are thought to be Belfast, Liverpool, Newquay, Prestwick Humberside, and Durham Tees Valley.
His comments came as he launched a public consultation on a new runway, unlikely to be operational until 2025.
Last October, after years of delay, the government said that building a third runway at Heathrow was its preferred option for expanding airport capacity.
Mr Grayling told the Commons that a third runway would generate tens of thousands of jobs, and be a major boost to the economy as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.
""By backing the north-west runway at Heathrow airport and publishing our proposals, we are sending a clear signal that when we leave the EU, we are open for business,"" Mr Grayling said.
With the government about to set out its strategy for withdrawal from the EU in a White Paper, Mr Grayling said that a third runway at Heathrow would enhance the UK's global links.
""Leaving the EU is a new chapter for Britain and provides us with a great opportunity to forge a new role in the world. We are determined to seize that opportunity and having the right infrastructure in place will allow us to build a more global Britain,"" he told MPs.
Alongside his announcement of a ""draft policy statement"" on Heathrow expansion, Mr Grayling also issued a consultation document on improving Britain's air space infrastructure and investing in new technology.
He said it made sense to carry out the two consultations together, which will run until 25 May, with the final decisions going before Parliament late this year or early 2018.
The consultations on Heathrow and air traffic facilities will involve events across the country ""because the whole country will benefit,"" Mr Grayling said. He is due in Glasgow later to expand on how travellers and freight users outside the south east England will benefit.
The cost of a third runway is estimated to be Â£22bn, and is forecast to generate about 70,000 jobs. An additional 260,000 take-offs or landings would be permitted each year from the expanded airport, on top of the current cap of 480,000.
The consultation will consider such things as pollution, additional rail and road infrastructure such a roads, and the impact on surrounding towns and villages.
But there is expected to be continued significant opposition to the third runway proposal.
Earlier, Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Sarah Olney, accused the government of being ""so desperate"" to reassure businesses about its Brexit plans that it is ""willing to steamroller over those communities opposed to Heathrow expansion"".
And John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan, said it was important that the government assessed the consultation ""in an even-handed way"" and rejected the plan if the expected impact on issues such as noise was found to be ""too great"".
The biggest long-term environmental challenge for aviation is climate change.
The government says a rise in aviation carbon emissions alone is no reason to reject expansion - unless that increase is so great it risks breaching the government's overall carbon targets.
But the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, previously warned that's exactly what's likely to happen.
They say growth in aviation emissions will mean ministers have to squeeze even deeper emissions cuts from other sectors of the economy.
They are already struggling to meet carbon targets in heating and transport and the committee says it has ""very limited confidence"" that sectors like steel-making and heavy industry can cut emissions even more to accommodate people flying.

"Medical professionals were quick to point out that the condition can be remedied quickly.
But what is walking - or atypical - pneumonia and how serious a setback is it for US Democratic presidential candidate?
Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs and is usually caused by bacteria. As the body attempts to fight the infection, the airways become inflamed and fill up with fluid. The disease is most dangerous among the young and the elderly.
Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term used to describe a mild form of pneumonia, which is often the result of an inhalation of bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
The symptoms of the infection can vary in severity.
Walking pneumonia is so mild that it can often be mistaken for a cold. Sufferers, although unwell, may feel healthy enough to continue to work. It rarely requires hospitalisation and can be cured in as little as a week.
In fact, Mrs Clinton said after emerging on Sunday from her daughter's home in New York: ""I'm feeling great. It's a beautiful day in New York.""
The condition causes coughing and sneezing and can result in fever-like symptoms, a high temperature, headaches and difficulty breathing - which can lead to dizziness and exhaustion. It also causes dehydration.
Anyone can contract pneumonia, which affects millions of people each year. Those who have respiratory health conditions such as lung disease or asthma are at risk of more severe manifestations of the illness.
The disease is contagious and spread through close contact, transmitted through sneezing or coughing. However the contagious period usually lasts less than 10 days.
As a presidential candidate, Mrs Clinton was at high risk of infection, according to Dr William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
""Candidates are constantly out in enclosed spaces, face to face with myriads of people,'' he said. ""It's an ideal opportunity for the transmission of a respiratory virus.""
In contrast to the more serious form of the condition, walking pneumonia can usually be treated effectively with a prescription of antibiotics taken at home with rest and by drinking plenty of fluids.
Mrs Clinton's doctor said in a statement that she had been prescribed antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule.","Medical professionals were quick to point out that the condition can be remedied quickly. But what is walking - or atypical - pneumonia and how serious a setback is it Walking pneumonia, also known as atypical pneumonia, is a less severe form of pneumonia compared to the traditional bacterial pneumonia. It is usually caused by certain bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or sometimes by viruses. 

Unlike typical pneumonia that requires bed rest and hospitalization, walking pneumonia is often milder and allows patients to continue their daily activities, such as walking around, hence the name. Symptoms of walking pneumonia can be similar to a common cold or flu, including cough, sore throat, fever, headache, and fatigue. However, the symptoms are generally less severe than those seen in typical pneumonia.

While walking pneumonia is generally less serious, it can still cause discomfort and may require medical attention. In some cases, if left untreated, it can lead to complications such as lung infections or respiratory problems. Therefore, seeking medical advice and following the prescribed treatment is important to ensure a prompt recovery and to prevent potential complications.

Overall, the seriousness of walking pneumonia as a setback would depend on the individual and their overall health condition. For healthy individuals with strong immune systems, the recovery is usually quick and the impact on daily life activities is minimal. However, for people with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions, the setback could be more significant and may require additional medical intervention. It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to assess the severity and appropriate course of action for individual cases."
"A Libyan military spokesman told the BBC that the ship's movements at the port of Derna had aroused suspicion.
The oil company rejected this, saying the ship was delivering fuel to industrial facilities there and the authorities had been kept informed.
Derna has been controlled by Islamist militants for the past two years.
The Libyan military attacked the port several times last year in an attempt to weaken militant groups there.
The military spokesman, Colonel Ahmed Mesmari, said the tanker had been targeted because it had failed to submit to an inspection before entering the port.
He said the vessel was supposed to dock at a power plant in Derna but instead ""took a different route"", entering a ""military zone"".
""We asked the ship to stop, but instead it turned off all its lights and would not respond so we were obliged to strike it.
""We bombed it twice,"" he said.
Libya's National Oil Corporation said the tanker had picked up 13,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil in Brega, a port south of Libya's second city, Benghazi, which it was due to deliver to a power plant and water purification facility in Derna.
It said the vessel was attacked before it could enter the port to unload its cargo.
There were 26 crew members on board the ship, Araevo, including nationals from the Philippines, Greece and Romania.
Two were injured in Sunday's attack, in addition to those killed.
The Liberian-flagged tanker is operated by an Athens-based shipping company, Aegean Shipping Enterprises Company.
The company said there was no leakage of oil and it was assessing the damage.
Col Mesmari told Reuters the vessel had been bringing Islamist fighters to Derna.
""We had warned any ship not to dock at the port without prior permission,"" he was quoted as saying.
The National Oil Corporation did not comment on the allegation but said the bombing of the tanker would have a ""very negative"" impact on oil shipping from Libyan ports.
It said it remained neutral in the conflict in Libya and the incident would hinder its ability to maintain supplies within the local market.
Libya has been in chaos since its long-time leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, was overthrown with Western military help in 2011.
Numerous militias govern their own patches of territory, with successive governments struggling to exercise control.
The competition for power and resources has led to frequent fighting and battles to control facilities, including ports, linked to Libya's oil industry.
The internationally recognised government is based in Tobruk, near the Egyptian border, having been expelled from the capital, Tripoli, by militias in 2014.
A rival militia-backed administration now controls the capital while Benghazi is largely in the hands of Islamist fighters.","A Libyan military spokesman told the BBC that the ship's movements at the port of Derna had aroused suspicion. The oil company rejected this, saying the ship was delivering fuel to meet the urgent needs of the local community. The Libyan military spokesperson, however, claimed that the ship's activities were not consistent with a regular fuel delivery and that they had reason to believe it might be involved in illegal activities.

The oil company retaliated by stating that they had valid documentation and had followed all necessary protocols for the fuel delivery. They emphasized that their primary goal was to support the local population during a critical time.

Tensions escalated between the Libyan military and the oil company as they continued to disagree on the nature of the ship's activities. The military spokesperson argued that they had intelligence suggesting the ship might be smuggling weapons or other contraband items.

In response, the oil company reaffirmed their commitment to transparency and cooperation, offering to provide additional information and documentation to address any concerns. They also urged the military to engage in dialogue rather than making baseless accusations.

The situation remained unresolved as both sides stood firm on their positions. International organizations and relevant authorities were called upon to investigate the matter and provide an impartial assessment."

It will attract more visitors, generate revenue, and contribute towards the development of the local hospitality sector. Moreover, with the addition of these two hotels, the city will have more options for accommodation, which will further enhance its reputation as a popular tourist destination.

Overall, the investment program by the hotel chain is set to bring numerous benefits to the city, including job creation, apprenticeship opportunities, increased tourism, and economic growth. It reflects their confidence in the city's potential and their commitment to its development."
"Outlining her plans for the UK leaving the EU, Theresa May said Brexit means leaving that union.
It currently allows tariff and paperwork-free trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
But the prime minister said: ""Full membership of the customs union prevents us from negotiating our own comprehensive trade deals.""
She said she would now seek to negotiate a new customs deal with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade to continue.
However, if a deal cannot be achieved it could lead to the return of some form of customs checks along the Irish border.
Posting on social media, Former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness said ""a border of the future is coming at us"".
What is a customs union and why does it matter?
A customs union is a form of trade agreement between two or more countries.
It means they decide not to impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union.
Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area.
The key argument for leaving the customs union is that it will allow the UK to negotiate its own trade agreements.

Reacting to the Brexit speech, Sinn Féin MLA John O'Dowd said: ""Exiting the single European market, exiting the customs union, creates a hard border on the island of Ireland.
""Warm words, soft words from Theresa May mean nothing.""
He added: ""Her intentions to leave the Single European Market and her intentions to leave the customs union are going to have a detrimental impact on the economy in the north and across this island.
""It's clear today from Theresa May's Brexit statement that the views and opinions of the people of north have been completely ignored.""
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""nowhere will be more damaged"" by the plan outlined by Mrs May than Northern Ireland.
""If the British Government can negotiate special arrangements on the common travel area, they can negotiate special arrangements for trade and customs.
""No free trade customs access across the island means a hard Brexit in Ireland. It means a hard border.""
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the prime minister's statement would give the business community ""more certainty"".
""I further welcome that the prime minister has set out her plan for an ambitious Free Trade Agreement with the European Union, whilst here in Northern Ireland we will also maintain the Common Travel Area with the Republic,"" he said.
""It must be pointed out we are leaving the European Union not Europe. Sinn Féin and others complain that her statement will mean a hard border, however, they now have no input as a result of bringing the assembly down.""
UUP economy spokesperson Steve Aiken said his party welcomed the prime minister's intention to retain the Common Travel Area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
He also said it was ""deeply concerning"" that ""there is no one expressing the unique needs"" of Northern Ireland after the dissolution of the Stormont assembly.
Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry described Mrs May's speech as ""catastrophic for Northern Ireland"".
""Any departure from the customs union and the single market will necessitate a formal border either across the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea.""
He added: ""A one-size-fits-all Brexit is just not practical. There are too many factors and circumstances particular to Northern Ireland.
""Yet, these have not yet been recognised and respected by the UK government.""
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny said he welcomed the ""clarity"" brought by Mrs May's speech.
However, he was criticised by Micheál Martin, the leader of the Republic's main opposition party Fianna Fail, who said Mrs May may be speaking softly but was acting in her own national interest.
He said Mrs May wanted to have her cake and eat it in her approach to Brexit.
The British and Irish Chamber of Commerce said the prime minister's pledge on leaving the customs union and EU single market would be ""alarming for businesses"".
The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association (NIIRTA) said governments in London, Dublin and Belfast must ""ensure that Brexit does not result in the hardening of the border and that no barriers whatsoever are placed on trade or workers across the EU"".
A group that represents Irish business, IBEC, hit out at the speech on social media saying  ""(The) UK's aggressive Brexit approach risks damaging UK-Irish relations.""
During her speech earlier on Tuesday, the prime minister said maintaining the common travel area between the UK and Republic of Ireland would be a priority during Brexit negotiations.
She said: ""No-one wants a return to the borders of the past.
""Our guiding principle must be to ensure that as we leave the European Union no new barriers to living or doing business within our own union are created.
""The United Kingdom will share a land border with the EU and maintaining that common travel area with the Republic of Ireland will be an important priority for the UK in the talks ahead.""
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Irish government said that while the prime minister's comments may be seen as a warning of a ""hard Brexit"", Dublin has been preparing for all possible models of future UK-EU relations.
Mrs May also said she hopes that the ""main parties"" in Northern Ireland will form a government as soon as possible in the ""spirit of unity"".
She added that the UK government had received papers from Scotland and Wales on Brexit, but did not mention receiving any papers from Northern Ireland.
NI Secretary James Brokenshire was legally obliged to call for the 2 March vote on Monday after the executive collapsed over a botched green scheme.
Stormont was plunged into crisis after the resignation of Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister last week.","Outlining her plans for the UK leaving the EU, Theresa May said Brexit means leaving that union. It currently allows tariff and paperwork-free trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. However, with Brexit, this arrangement would change, and a physical border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) would be necessary. To avoid a hard border and preserve the peace process in Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement, May proposed the backstop solution.

The backstop is a legally binding insurance policy aimed at avoiding a hard border. It ensures that in the absence of a future trade agreement between the UK and the EU, there will be no physical checks or infrastructure at the border. Instead, the UK would remain in a temporary customs arrangement with the EU, with Northern Ireland following some EU regulations to maintain regulatory alignment.

However, the backstop has been a contentious issue in negotiations between the UK and the EU. Many critics, especially those in May's own party, argue that it could trap the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely and prevent the UK from striking trade deals with other countries. They believe it undermines the sovereignty and independence that Brexit promised.

Despite the opposition, May tried multiple times to get her withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, approved by the UK Parliament. However, her deal was rejected multiple times, causing increased uncertainty and political deadlock.

In July 2019, May stepped down as Prime Minister, and her successor, Boris Johnson, took office. Johnson vowed to remove the controversial backstop from the withdrawal agreement and negotiate a new deal with the EU. However, the EU has consistently maintained that the backstop is an essential part of any agreement to prevent a hard border and protect the peace in Northern Ireland.

As of October 2021, the UK and the EU have reached a revised agreement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. This protocol establishes a unique set of customs and regulatory arrangements for Northern Ireland. While it avoids a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, it has faced criticism from some Unionist groups in Northern Ireland who believe it creates barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Overall, the issue of the backstop and the future relationship between the UK and the EU remains highly contentious and subject to ongoing negotiations and debates."
"President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has served two consecutive terms and under Argentina's constitution is barred from running again until 2019.
The swearing-in ceremony on 10 December of whoever gets elected as the new president will officially mark the end of 12 years of Kirchnerism, the political movement named after President Fernandez de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor in office, Nestor Kirchner.
Irene Caselli looks at some of the policies that left a mark on the country and which have divided voters.
Passed in 2009, the universal child allowance is arguably the most widely accepted social policy in Argentina.
It provides financial support to parents who are unemployed or work in the informal sector.
Parents receive a monthly stipend for each child under the age of 18 for up to five children.
They receive 837 Argentine pesos ($88, £57 at the official market exchange rate) per child per month.
Eighty percent of that sum is handed to them on a monthly basis, while the remaining 20% are retained until the start of the school year in March, when parents have to produce school attendance certificates and vaccination records in order to receive the outstanding amount.
The scheme has been praised by supporters and opponents of the president alike although its long-term effects on health, education and poverty remain to be determined.
When Nestor Kirchner came into office in 2003, Argentina was facing a deep economic crisis.
The country was still reeling from its $100bn default - at the time the biggest sovereign debt default in history.
He began a process of restructuring the debt that had been defaulted on.
In 2005, a majority of creditors agreed to swap their bonds for new ones that left them with little more than 30 cents on the dollar.
A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the percentage of renegotiated bonds to 93%.
The remaining 7% refused a deal and became known as the holdouts.
While even critics of Kirchnerism recognise the importance of the debt restructuring deals, some bemoan the government's failure to settle the long-running $1.3bn dispute with the holdouts, which has locked Argentina out of capital markets for a decade.

The opposition blames the Kirchners for rising inflation, lowering purchasing power and stagnant growth.
Since Argentina is cut off from borrowing on international capital markets, the government imposed strict currency and capital controls to avoid capital flight.
The amount of dollars available at the official rate is limited but demand remains high, leading to a soaring black market and an overvalued currency.
Government officials estimated that inflation would hit 14.4% this year, but independent economist predicted almost double that: 25% annually.
As inflation rises, the peso has increasingly less purchasing power.
The price of some basic goods has been stabilised thanks to an agreement between the national government and local businesses.
But critics say this only distorts the economy further.

When it comes to the justice system, the Kirchners' legacy is highly divisive.
Supporters highlight the government's decision to overturn amnesty laws which protected lower-ranking members of the military from prosecution for crimes committed during Argentina's military rule from 1976 to 1983.
One thousand former members of the military have been charged thanks to this change in the law.
But critics accuse the Kirchners of co-opting the justice system, slowing down and obstructing any investigation that could affect the government, from corruption charges involving Vice-President Amado Boudou to the death in mysterious circumstance of prosecutor Alberto Nisman.
Over the past 12 years, the Kirchners re-nationalised many companies which had been privatised during the 1990s.
Argentina's postal service, its radio spectrum and Buenos Aires's water company were nationalised early on under Nestor Kirchner.
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner drove the re-nationalisation of arguably the four most important companies: national carrier Aerolineas Argentinas, oil company YPF, Argentina's railway system and its pension fund.
While some celebrate these as an important reassertion of state control in the economy, critics complain of inefficiency and of government interference.
In 2010, Argentina became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex marriage.
The law gave gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals, including adoption and inheritance rights.
In 2012, parliament approved a ""gender identity law"", which allowed for changes to be made to people's gender, image, or birth name on civil registries.
However, discrimination and violence against transgender people remains high.
Three transgender people have been killed in recent weeks.
Left-wing critics say the government has not been progressive enough to legalise abortion or the sale and consumption of marijuana, as neighbouring Uruguay has.",President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has served two consecutive terms and under Argentina's constitution is barred from running again until 2019. The swearing-in ceremony on 10 December of whoever gets elected as the new president will mark the end of Fernandez de Kirchner's tenure.
"External experts reviewed the deaths, which occurred at Royal Oldham Hospital and North Manchester General Hospital between January 2013 and July 2014.
They found a ""notable absence of clinical leadership"" resulting in a ""failure to adequately plan care"".
Pennine Acute NHS Trust apologised to the families of those who died.
A trust spokesman said he could not comment on whether any of the deaths resulted from failings, saying it was a ""legal matter for the coroner"".
The review, carried out by a senior midwife and an obstetrician outside the trust, found risk management during and before labour were ""below standard, which may have contributed to the poor outcomes"".
Three cases involved women medically classed as obese, with their needs ""not managed in line with local and national guidance"".
Twelve recommendations were made, including improving how serious incidents were dealt with and reviewing the process for employing locum doctors.
Three maternal deaths ""did not appear to be the result of deficiencies in care"".
The trust said it was investing more than Â£1m by recruiting 40 new healthcare assistants to support patients and midwives.
Thomas Beaty was one of seven babies who died. His parents earlier said they believed he would still be alive ""if it were not for the actions of Royal Oldham Hospital"".
He suffered severe head injuries after five attempts were made to deliver him using forceps.
National guidelines recommend no more than three attempts.
Gill Harris, chief nurse at the trust, said the incidents ""should be seen in the context of approximately 10,000 births a year"" at the hospitals.
She said: ""The trust board today repeated sincere apologies to all of the families involved for the failings in care which had been identified. I have met with a number of the families and have reiterated the offer to meet with the remaining families, if they wish.
""The review of the incidents found that whilst the maternal deaths did not appear to be the result of deficiencies in care, further scrutiny and improvement was required from the review of the neonatal deaths.""
The trust will now be twinned with the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as a ""shared learning arrangement"".","External experts reviewed the deaths, which occurred at Royal Oldham Hospital and North Manchester General Hospital between January 2013 and July 2014. They found a ""notable absence of clinical leadership"" and identified several factors that contributed to the deaths, including inadequate monitoring, failure to recognize deteriorating patients, and delays in treatment.

The external experts, who were appointed by the healthcare regulator, also highlighted a lack of communication and coordination among staff members, as well as insufficient training in critical care. They emphasized the need for strong clinical leadership and called for improvements in the management and supervision of medical teams.

According to the report, the absence of clinical leadership resulted in a ""culture of blame and defensiveness"" within the hospitals. This culture hindered open and honest discussions about mistakes and prevented the implementation of necessary changes to improve patient safety.

The experts made a series of recommendations to address the issues identified, including the establishment of clear leadership structures, regular clinical governance meetings, and the implementation of a robust training program for all staff involved in patient care.

The hospitals have acknowledged the findings of the report and have committed to implementing the recommended changes. They have also apologized to the families of the patients who died and assured them that lessons have been learned to prevent similar incidents in the future.

The findings of the external review have highlighted the importance of clinical leadership in healthcare settings. It is crucial for medical teams to have strong leaders who can effectively coordinate and manage patient care, ensuring that best practices are followed and potential problems are identified and addressed promptly. By fostering a culture of open communication and continuous improvement, hospitals can strive to provide safe and high-quality care for their patients."

"Aberdeen said it had identified savings after weakness in emerging markets drove more cash out of its funds in the first two months of 2014.
The company reported outflows of £3.9bn, largely from its Asian and emerging market equity funds.
Money leaving its funds slowed in March with outflows expected at about £200m.
Its share price was up by about 7.9% at 15:00 on Tuesday.
In a statement, Aberdeen said it secured £4bn in gross new business in the first two months of the year and had a strong pipeline.
Total assets under management at the end of February were £186.5bn.
The update came as Aberdeen confirmed its £550m takeover of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) had been completed.
It leaves the newly-joined Aberdeen company with assets under management - backdated to 28 February - of £324.5bn.
In the trading update, Aberdeen chief executive Martin Gilbert said: ""Encouraging inflows to emerging market debt, high yield bonds and property have partly offset net outflows from our Asian and emerging market equity products, and we have seen further growth in the pipeline of new business awarded but not funded at the end of February.
""Conditions in emerging markets remain subdued, and we have therefore identified and are implementing some cost savings, over and above the synergies we expect from the SWIP transaction.
""However, we will not change our long-term approach to investment which has delivered excellent returns to our clients over time and we look forward to building on the additional scale and product diversity that the acquisition of SWIP brings.""","Aberdeen said it had identified savings after weakness in emerging markets drove more cash out of its funds in the first two months of 2014. The company reported outflows of £6.5 billion ($10.9 billion) in the first two months of 2014, compared to net inflows of £1.7 billion ($2.8 billion) in the same period last year. This decline in funds was primarily due to investors pulling money out of emerging market funds as concerns grew over economic stability in countries like China and Brazil. However, despite the outflows, Aberdeen stated that it had identified savings that would help mitigate the impact on its profitability. The company also mentioned that it remained focused on its long-term strategy and believed in the potential of emerging markets."
"The BBC has learned that Platini - after receiving indications of support from four continental confederations - will be a candidate when polling takes place on 26 February.
The 60-year-old former France and Juventus midfielder could declare as early as Wednesday.
Switzerland's Sepp Blatter, 79, has been in charge of Fifa since 1998.
Media playback is not supported on this device
He is standing down as a result of a corruption crisis at world football's governing body.
Platini is the overwhelming favourite to replace him.
As well as the backing of his own European confederation, he is understood to have gained support from:
If every football association within those confederations voted for Platini, he would secure 144 votes, which is more than enough for him to be elected as Blatter's successor.
That is unlikely to happen, however, given some football associations will back rival candidates or abstain.
Nevertheless, Platini is still expected to poll a significant number of votes.
The election will be held in Zurich at an emergency congress attended by the Fifa member associations.
Candidates have until 26 October to be nominated.
As a player, Platini won three Ballon d'Or titles in the mid 1980s as well as a European Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and Super Cup with Juventus.
The former Nancy and Saint-Etienne midfielder, who became famous for his ability to score from free-kicks, also won league titles in France and Italy.

"Brent crude fell 4.7%, hitting fresh 11-year lows, while US crude was down 3.9% at its lowest level since 2008.
Brent recovered to $33.95, down less than 1% on the day, while US crude climbed back to $33.42, down 1.6%.
Oversupply has hit oil prices, which are now 70% lower than in June 2014.
Companies and governments that rely heavily on oil revenues have been suffering as a result.
Adding to the continuing fall in oil prices, China depreciated the yuan on Thursday, sending regional currencies and stock markets tumbling.
Demand for crude tends to fall when the US dollar is stronger against currencies of purchasing countries, and China remains the world's biggest energy consumer.
China's stock markets were suspended less than half an hour into trading on Thursday, after falling 7% and triggering a new circuit-breaking mechanism for the second time this week.
Overnight, the US Department of Energy's weekly report showed a sharp drop in US commercial crude inventories of 5.1 million barrels to 482.3 million.
The government data also showed a gain in US crude production of 17,000 barrels a day, taking it to 9.22 million barrels a day, the fourth consecutive week of increases. There was also a rise in stockpiles at the Cushing oil hub in Oklahoma.
Oil is so oversupplied globally that countries are running out of storage.
The US, which is thought to have among the largest storage facilities in the world, has nowhere left to keep it, according to Paul Stevens, professor emeritus at the University of Dundee and a Middle East specialist.
""Storage is pretty much full and people are already talking about buying tankers as floating storage,"" he said.
""But if supply continues to outstrip demand, then the only thing that you can do with the oil is sell it, which inevitably pushes the price down.""
The huge storage overhang means that even if US production falls this year, as oil companies halt production, it will take several months to get rid of excess supplies.","Brent crude fell 4.7%, hitting fresh 11-year lows, while US crude was down 3.9% at its lowest level since 2008. Brent recovered to $33.95, down less than 1% on the day, while US crude was trading at $32.70, down nearly 2% from its lowest point. The decline in oil prices was driven by concerns over global oversupply and the slowing demand from major economies, such as China. Additionally, the ongoing tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Saudi Arabia, have contributed to the decline in oil prices."
"Salah Farah was shot in the attack in north-eastern Kenya in December and later died from his bullet wound.
The insurgents told the Muslims and Christians to split up but he was among Muslim passengers who refused to do so.
President Uhuru Kenyatta said he was awarding the Order Of The Grand Warrior to Mr Farah ""for his act of courage"".
It is one of the country's top honours and is awarded by the president for exemplary service to the country.
In previous attacks in the area, Somalia-based al-Shabab militants have killed Christians and spared Muslims.
Mr Kenyatta made the announcement during his state of the union address in parliament.
He said that he was proud that Kenyan had ""refused to be divided by terrorism"".
The bus was packed with about 60 passengers travelling from the capital, Nairobi, to the town of Mandera when it was forced to stop on 20 December by gunmen firing shots.
Muslim women quickly offered Christian women scarves to cover their heads when they were ordered off the bus near the village of El Wak on the Somali border.
The year before, a survivor of a similar attack recounted how passengers had been spared if they could recite the Koran.
But Mr Farah, the deputy head of the Mandera township primary school, told Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper that the Muslim passengers had confronted the gunmen.
""We asked them to kill all of us or leave us alone,"" he said.
While this confrontation continued, a lorry approached and the militants ambushed this vehicle too, killing an off-duty policeman.
The BBC's Bashkas Jugsodaay in Garissa says the militants then abandoned their attempt to kill the Christian bus passengers as the Muslims were refusing to co-operate with them.
Altogether three people died at the scene of the incident, including two passengers - one of whom had tried to run away - and at least two were wounded.
Mr Farah died a month later in the capital, Nairobi, during surgery.
Our reporter says the mainly Muslim north-east is heavily dependent on teachers and health workers who come to work there from other parts of Kenya.
But in a brutal bus attack in November 2014, 20 of the 28 passengers killed were teachers returning home for the Christmas holidays.
This led many civil servants to refuse to return to their posts - not helped by the deadly attack on Garissa University last April.
Al-Shabab has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush the al Qaeda-linked militants.

He went on the wrong side of a fork in the road and hit an oncoming car.
Fitzpatrick was convicted of dangerous driving at Mold Crown Court and banned from driving for 12 months.
Judge Rhys Rowlands told him he could not imagine anyone ""in a million years"" failing to realise they were entering a dual carriageway.
He said Fitzpatrick, who was travelling with his wife and baby in his BMW, had been guilty of ""a woeful lack of attention.""
Student Jessica Broom, from Wrexham, was driving along the road at nearly 50mph (80km/h) in her Renault Clio at about 21:40 BST when she saw Fitzpatrick's car coming towards her.
The two cars crashed and Ms Broom needed hospital treatment for her injuries.
The court heard Fitzpatrick's injuries stopped him from becoming a member of the British fell running team.
He claimed the sign in the middle of the road at Pontblyddyn in Flintshire, indicating which side to drive on, had been obscured and genuinely thought he was on a single carriageway.

The company says that the shareholder resolutions are unnecessary, while the investigations by several states are ""politically motivated.""
For around a quarter of a century, a varied collection of climate activists and institutions concerned about rising temperatures have attempted to get Exxon Mobil to move forward on the issue of climate change.
This year, they believe the coalition attempting to force change on the issue, is the strongest ever assembled. Investors with at least $8tn under management have indicated they will support greater recognition of the climate change issue.
At the AGM here in Dallas, the company faces resolutions including one to appoint a board member who has a high degree of climate expertise.
One motion asks the company to support the goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees in line with the Paris climate agreement. Another asks Exxon to disclose how resilient its investments would be if policy measures to restrict warming to 2 degrees were implemented.
This motion has a number of supporters including the Norwegian government's pension fund, the world's largest.
It's being co-sponsored by the Church Commissioners, who manage the Church of England's investment fund.
Their head of responsible investment says the board of Exxon Mobil should now recognise the new realities.
""It's a moment where Exxon really has to recognise that the world is changing,"" Edward Mason told BBC News.
""Climate change is real, the transition to a low carbon economy is real, and they need to get on board with this.""
The shareholders' hopes of success have been boosted by a number of factors, including a growing number of institutional investors Schroders, AXA and Legal and General which have supported the proposal. They are also backed by the largest pension fund in the US, CalPERS.
The world's leading advisers to proxy voters, ISS and Glass Lewis, have also come out in favour of the resolution on climate risk disclosure. A group of 1,000 academics from leading institutions have written to support the resolutions.
Shareholder pressure has also been successful at other large oil companies, with BP and Shell both accepting resolutions to routinely report on their asset portfolio's resilience to climate change.
The board of Exxon Mobil are resolutely opposed to the motions on increased cognisance of climate change issues.
While the climate resolutions are non-binding on the company, many believe that if they are supported by a majority of shareholders, Exxon Mobil will have to make significant changes.
""I think they will have to change or die because you are going to get nation states demanding that they change,"" said Capuchin priest Fr Michael Crosby who has been attempting to get Exxon Mobil to change on this issue for 19 years.
Exxon can trace its origins back to 1870 when John D Rockefeller created the Standard Oil Company .
Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999 in a deal valued around $80bn. The combined value of the company in 2015 was $353bn, making it the world's most valuable, publicly traded oil company.
The company employs around 75,000 around the world.
The oil spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1989 was the biggest in US history until Deepwater Horizon in 2010.
In 2016, the Rockefeller foundation said it would eliminate its holdings in Exxon, saying the company had misled the public over climate change.
""The countries where they operate are going to say you can't do what you're doing and will tax them out of existence or what ever.""
Exxon says that climate change is a ""very real"" issue for the company but believes the shareholders' resolutions are unnecessary. They say that since 2007 they have included a proxy price for carbon in all their forecasts, which essentially means they have been factoring in a likely cost of more restrictive CO2 policies.
""I think the 'change or die' comments are a little dramatic, Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told BBC News.
""The issue is an important one, climate change presents very real risks that need to be managed but so do energy requirements of the modern economy. So we see that as a dual challenge to continue to provide that energy that all of us depend on while also managing the risks of climate change.""
As well as dealing with shareholder activism on the issue of climate change, Exxon is also facing a number of legal challenges on the same issue.
Over the last year though, a number of journalistic investigations have raised questions about when Exxon's researchers first knew about climate change and how much information they passed on to shareholders and the general public.
Attorneys General from New York, Massachusetts, California and the US Virgin Islands have launched investigations into Exxon to determine if they acted fraudulently.
The Virgin Islands investigation has particularly irked the company as it seeks to uncover links between Exxon and private organisations that may have been used to spread doubt about climate science, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
""If a company knew that climate posed serious risks but nonetheless sought to convince large numbers of consumers and investors that those risks were overstated, I think that is a serious matter for investigation,"" Carroll Muffett from the Centre for International Environmental Law.
""The reality facing the oil industry is that their situation is looking increasingly like the situation of the tobacco companies - and as much as they like to claim there are no parallels, there is more and more information coming to light that says there are parallels and they are real.""
Exxon Mobil and their supporters have come out fighting on this question, decrying the investigations as an attack on freedom of speech.
""There is a pretty defined strategy to go back and try to paint us as some sort of big tobacco and we categorically reject that and it does not stand up to independent scrutiny,"" said Alan Jeffers, from Exxon.
The Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that the Virgin Islands investigation was ""ridiculous"", and said it was an ""effort to punish Exxon for daring to hold an opinion on climate change that differs from that of radical environmentalists"".

Exxon Mobil is also being investigated for potential fraud by multiple attorney generals for misleading the public and investors about climate change risks. These investors argue that Exxon Mobil should take concrete actions to align its business strategy with the goals of the Paris Agreement and transition to a low-carbon economy.

They believe that as the largest publicly traded oil company, Exxon Mobil has a significant role to play in addressing climate change. They are pushing for the company to disclose its plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, invest in renewable energy technologies, and diversify its business away from fossil fuels.

The investigation for potential fraud against Exxon Mobil stems from allegations that the company may have downplayed the risks associated with climate change and misled investors about the financial impact it could have on their investments. These allegations suggest that the company's actions may have violated securities laws by providing false or incomplete information to investors.

If the investigation finds evidence of fraud, Exxon Mobil could face legal consequences and financial penalties. The allegations have sparked a broader conversation about the responsibility of fossil fuel companies and whether they should be held accountable for their contribution to climate change.

Investors and environmental activists are increasingly calling for greater transparency and action from oil companies to address climate change. They argue that the risks associated with climate change, including regulatory changes, shifts in consumer preferences, and the need to transition to a low-carbon economy, could significantly impact the long-term financial stability of these companies.

Exxon Mobil has defended its stance, stating that it supports the goal of limiting global warming but believes that fossil fuels will continue to play a significant role in meeting the world's energy needs for several decades. The company has also emphasized the investments it has made in research and development of low-carbon technologies.

The outcome of these investor demands and investigations will likely have a significant impact on both Exxon Mobil and the broader oil industry. It could shape the company's strategy, influence investor sentiment, and potentially set a precedent for other companies in the sector."
"The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.
Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.
Experts said the team was ""close to the money"" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.
There are clocks throughout the body and a ""master clock"" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.
Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.
The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.
The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.
The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.
It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.
The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.
Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.
When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.
Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.
The study's authors concluded: ""Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders.

""Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment.""
Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field.
""There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money.""
However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.
Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers.
""The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes.""","The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain. Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the brain's internal clock completely off. The researchers discovered a cluster of neurons in the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that acts as the master clock, controlling the circadian rhythm. By using optogenetics, a technique that involves using light to control neuron activity, the team was able to activate or deactivate these neurons in mice. When the SCN neurons were deactivated, the mice lost their sense of time and their circadian rhythm became completely disrupted. This finding has significant implications for understanding and treating sleep disorders, as well as potential applications in jet lag and shift work. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term effects and potential risks of manipulating the brain's internal clock."
"The meeting between Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro will be the first top-level negotiations between the two countries for more than half a century.
Mr Obama has signalled he is prepared to take Cuba off Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
The two leaders met briefly at the summit's opening ceremony.
They shook hands in their first encounter since a thaw in relations began in December.
But Saturday's historic talks could be overshadowed by tensions between Venezuela and the US.
Ahead of the summit, Mr Obama told Latin American leaders that the days when his country could freely interfere in regional affairs are past.

Scenes from a warming US-Cuba relationship
The US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1959 after Fidel Castro and his brother Raul led a revolution toppling US-backed President Fulgencio Batista. The Castros established a revolutionary socialist state with close ties to the Soviet Union.
At past Summits of the Americas, which bring together the leaders of North, Central and South America, the US has come in for criticism for its embargo against Cuba and its objection to Cuban participation.
This seventh summit is the first which Cuba is attending. Much of the attention will be focused on the body language between the former foes.
No meeting has been formally scheduled between the two leaders, but White House officials have indicated that substantive talks are almost certain to go ahead, AP reports.
The US president is expected to raise the issue of political reform in Cuba.
Meanwhile Havana is seeking an end to the US trade embargo and removal from Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Mr Obama has indicated he is ready to delist Cuba but it is not clear whether this will happen at the meeting or later.
Cuba's presence on the list has been one of the main hurdles on the way to closer ties between the two countries.
On Friday, Mr Obama and Mr Castro joined representatives from 35 nations for the summit's inauguration ceremony.
A marching band and children in national dress of the participating countries waved flags as the summit opened to applause.
The smooth progress made between Cuba and the US stands in contrast to the bumpy ride that US-Venezuela relations have experienced over the past months.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors for more than six years. Tensions rose last month when the US imposed sanctions on a group of Venezuelan officials it accuses of human rights abuses.
As part of the sanctions, Mr Obama issued an executive order declaring Venezuela a threat to US national security.
President Maduro has collected more than 10 million signatures demanding its repeal.
Their meeting at the summit, while less historic than the one between Mr Castro and Mr Obama, is drawing as much attention for its unpredictability.
Mr Maduro sent out mixed messages on Friday, visiting a monument to victims of the 1989 US invasion of Panama but also saying that Venezuela was at the summit ""in a constructive spirit, to make history through respect"".","The meeting between Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro will be the first top-level negotiations between the two countries for more than half a century. Mr Obama has signalled he is open to improving relations with Cuba since he took office in 2009. The meeting is seen as a significant step towards normalizing diplomatic ties between the United States and Cuba.

During their meeting, President Obama and President Castro are expected to discuss a wide range of topics, including economic cooperation, travel restrictions, human rights issues, and the reopening of embassies in each other's countries.

Both leaders have expressed optimism about the potential for improved relations between the two countries. However, many challenges remain, including the US embargo on Cuba, which can only be lifted by Congress.

The meeting is expected to be a historic moment in the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba. It is hoped that it will pave the way for further dialogue and collaboration between the two countries in the years to come."
"Councillors backed proposals for the scheme on a plot owned by The Church Commissioners in Grovebury Road, Leighton Buzzard, last year.
Protesters said the church ""should not be making money from destroying our precious town centre"".
A Church Commissioners' spokesman said they took their obligations seriously.
The scheme, which includes a DIY unit, four other shops and a restaurant, was approved by Central Bedfordshire Council in February 2013.
But Friends of the Earth campaign coordinator Victoria Harvey believes it will lead to a ""dead town centre which harms the community"".
She said the plans ""do not not provide anything new"" but would ""take a minimum of Â£2m in trade"" from the town centre.
An application for a judicial review on these grounds was turned down and Ms Harvey has now gone to the Court of Appeal.
The London protest was to ""put pressure on The Church Commissioners"", Ms Harvey said.
""We are hoping the church takes its commitment to be sensitive to communities seriously and changes its mind,"" she added.
Church Commissioners, which raise money through an investment portfolio, said they respected the right to ""stage a peaceful protest"" but the planning and legal processes had been ""thorough"".
""The commissioners always take into account local interest and planning regulations and take seriously their obligation and right under the Charities Act to seek the best price possible while selling land or buildings,"" a spokesman said.
""The proposed development will .... provide a much-needed facility for the town, attract new inward investment and create a large number of jobs for local people.""

"With one person still unaccounted for, authorities are searching the rubble for survivors at the scene.
Telescopic cameras and sound devices have been deployed to search small spaces in the wreckage.
Less than 50% of debris has been removed from the site after Wednesday's incident, which injured more than 60.
""We have to think of survivors and work in that way, with hope,"" Fire Department of New York Chief Edward Kilduff told US media of the ongoing operation.
Bulldozers are removing debris from the scene in the Park Avenue and 116th Street area, with authorities aiming to reach the first floor by Saturday and then on to the basement to search for victims.
On Friday, city officials and utility company Con Edison continued to search for the source of a gas leak believed to have caused the explosion.
In question is whether the city's aging gas and water mains, dating as far back as the 1800s, played a role.
New York City still uses an estimated 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of old cast-iron pipe to deliver gas.
The old infrastructure poses a ""fundamental challenge"", according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Local residents were said to have complained recently about ""unbearable"" gas smells in the area, raising questions about whether such complaints were ignored.
Con Edison said a resident in a nearby building reported smelling gas shortly before the incident, but a team of engineers did not arrive until it was too late.
Edward Foppiano, a Con Ed spokesman, said there was only one gas odour complaint on record with the utility from either address. It was from last May and involved a small leak, according to the utility.","With one person still unaccounted for, authorities are searching the rubble for survivors at the scene. Telescopic cameras and sound devices have been deployed to search small spaces in the rubble, while rescue dogs are being used to detect any signs of life. Drones equipped with thermal cameras are also being utilized to help locate any individuals who may be trapped or injured.

Rescue teams are working tirelessly, carefully removing debris and using specialized equipment such as hydraulic cutters and saws to clear pathways in the rubble. They are prioritizing areas where survivors are most likely to be found, such as areas with voids or air pockets.

The use of telescopic cameras allows rescue workers to peer into tight spaces where it may be difficult to physically reach. These cameras can provide a visual assessment of the situation and help rescuers determine the best approach to safely retrieve anyone trapped.

Sound devices are being used to pick up any faint sounds or cries for help that might be coming from beneath the rubble. Sensitive microphones can detect even the slightest noises, aiding in the search for survivors.

Rescue teams are coordinating their efforts, communicating via two-way radios and wireless headsets to efficiently cover the vast amount of debris. They are constantly updating one another on any potential signs of survivors or hazards they may encounter.

The search and rescue operation is a race against time, as the chances of finding survivors decrease with each passing hour. However, the authorities are dedicated to leaving no stone unturned and will continue their rigorous search until the missing person is accounted for.

"An avid drawer of cartoons as a child, he was determined to become a professional cartoonist.
So, aged 19, Mauricio left his small home town and moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, to pursue his dream.
Intending to produce cartoons for a newspaper, he was instead repeatedly turned down. He was told that his work wasn't good enough.
But not a person to be deterred, the young Mauricio came up with a plan - he'd get a different job on a newspaper, while continuing to practise and improve his skills as a cartoonist in his spare time.
His thinking was that once he was more established at a paper, he'd then try again - and again - to get his cartoons accepted.
So despite the sight of blood making him feel faint, in 1954 Mauricio got a job as a crime reporter on one of Brazil's bestselling titles - Folha de Sao Paulo.
""Of course it was not the start I dreamed about, but we can not be picky when we are starting, and I had to do what they allowed me to do,"" says Mauricio, who is now 80 years old.
He had to wait five years before he got a cartoon accepted.
That first daily comic strip was about a dog who engaged in philosophical conversations. It was popular enough for Mauricio to be able to quit reporting, and become a full-time cartoonist.
Almost six decades later, Mauricio has sold more than one billion comics and books.
A household name in Brazil, his work is also translated and sold around the world.
In addition, his company - Mauricio de Sousa Productions (MSP) - produces animated films and theatre productions, runs a theme park, makes computer games and cuddly toys, and licenses his characters to hundreds of consumer products.
While Mauricio doesn't like to discuss money, he is a multi-millionaire many times over.
He is also a workaholic who still leads the business every day, and has no plans to retire. ""I work whenever I'm awake,"" he says.
Mauricio's most popular cartoon character is a seven-year-old girl called Monica, who appeared for the first time in 1963.
Named after one of his daughters, the fictional Monica is a strong-minded child who leads a gang of friends.
As Monica's adventures gained a loyal readership, Mauricio says that thanks to his mother's advice he made sure that he focused on his business affairs as much as he did on his writing and drawing.
""Something my mother used to advise me was that if I wanted to become a cartoonist I should do my drawing in the morning, and manage the business in the afternoon,"" he says.
Mauricio also started to hire staff to assist him, and travelled around Brazil to sell his cartoons to other newspapers.
Within three years his cartoons were being published in no less than 400 Brazilian newspapers, and his earnings soared.
Today, Mauricio says that while the comics are his ""calling card"", most of the company's profits comes from licensed products. His characters can be found on everything from nappies to furniture, clothing, and food items.
It is this business acumen as much as Mauricio's cartoon drawing skills that have seen him compared with the late Walt Disney.
Yet as much as Mauricio has focused on his finances, he has also been honoured for his efforts to use his cartoons - which include no less than 200 different characters - to promote good causes.
Themes he has promoted include protecting the rainforests, anti-smoking, vaccinations, the need for clean water, tackling pollution, and fighting drugs.
This work has seen him receive an award from the Pan American Health Organization, the public health agency that operates in all 35 nations across North and South America.
Mauricio is also the holder of a Brazilian presidential medal of honour, and his Monica cartoon character was named a United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (Unicef) ambassador in 2007.
The first ever fictional character to be given the title, she was chosen because of her positive influence on children and families.
Looking ahead, Mauricio says that while he has no plans to retire, he has held ""occasional meetings"" about the issue, ""because I do not want all this work to be damaged by bad planning"".
In running the company he is helped by two of his 10 children, who hold senior roles.
Eladio Toldeo, a Brazilian business consultant, says that while the eventual leadership transition will need to be handled well, ""Mauricio's legacy will remain regardless of who is managing the company"" and its 500 employees.
In the meantime, Mauricio says: ""Holidays make me restless because I do not like the idea of being three or four days without creating something.
""I need to take as much as I can from my mind, and create books, comic strips and other products for children. It is not a material need, it is something else.""

So, aged 19, Mauricio left his small home town and moved to Sao Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. Sao Paulo was known for its vibrant arts and culture scene, making it the perfect place for Mauricio to pursue his dreams.

Mauricio started by studying fine arts at a renowned university in Sao Paulo. He immersed himself in various artistic disciplines, honing his skills in drawing, painting, and sculpture. However, his true passion remained cartoons and comic strips.

To support himself financially, Mauricio took up odd jobs during the day while dedicating his evenings to developing his cartooning style. He attended comic book conventions and networked with fellow artists, hoping to catch a break in the industry.

One day, Mauricio stumbled upon an opportunity to work as an assistant for a well-known comic strip artist. He eagerly seized the chance, learning valuable techniques and gaining insights into the world of professional cartooning. As he honed his craft, Mauricio started creating his own comic strips, sending them to various newspapers and magazines in the hopes of showcasing his talent.

After several rejection letters, Mauricio's perseverance finally paid off. A local newspaper recognized his unique style and decided to publish one of his comic strips. The strip gained popularity, and Mauricio's talent began to be noticed by a wider audience.

Encouraged by this success, Mauricio decided to launch his own comic book series. Drawing inspiration from Brazilian folklore and his own vivid imagination, he created the iconic character ""Monica"" and her group of friends known as ""Monica's Gang."" The comic book became an instant hit, capturing the hearts of children and adults alike with its humorous and relatable storytelling.

Mauricio's success continued to grow, and Monica's Gang became a beloved franchise that extended into various forms of media, including TV shows, movies, merchandise, and even theme parks. Mauricio became a household name, and his cartoons became a significant part of Brazilian pop culture.

Throughout his career, Mauricio always stayed true to his passion for cartoons. He believed that everyone had a childlike imagination waiting to be tapped into, and his artwork aimed to inspire and entertain people of all ages.

Decades later, Mauricio's dedication and talent have made him an internationally recognized cartoonist. He remains an influential figure in the world of comics and continues to create new stories, characters, and adventures that captivate audiences worldwide. Mauricio's journey from a small town boy to a renowned cartoonist stands as a testament to the power of following one's dreams and never giving up."

Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Hywel Williams asked Mr Cairns why he missed the board meeting in Mumbai at which the decision to sell off its UK assets was taken.
""What stopped you? Was it the Cabinet pecking order? Was it indolence? Or was it just plain ignorance?"" he said.

Labour Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith demanded assurances that Tata Steel would not syphon off its most profitable lines to its plans abroad.
Mr Cairns said a positive engagement between the government and Tata had led to the decision to sell off the assets as a whole rather than to dispose of some of the more profitable assets.
Mr Cairns had earlier told MPs: ""The steel industry is currently dealing with unparalleled global economic conditions and the UK is deeply concerned by the social and economic impact they are having in south Wales.

But two veterans interviewed for the BBC's Week In Week Out programme claim it was the therapy they received at Healing the Wounds that made them feel suicidal.
Both men, one of whom went undercover for the programme, said they felt worse after their treatment.
Dr Neil Kitchiner, head of the NHS All Wales Veterans Health and Wellbeing service, said he has not seen evidence of the treatment working.
""None of them are cured as far as I've seen, after three days treatment,"" he said.
""Some have been made very unwell as a result of going there and have needed a lot of support from NHS and veterans' charities.
""We have asked them to stop it.
""We have shown the evidence from the NHS and from the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, we've shared our concerns with them and yet they continue to operate in the way they do.""
Healing The Wounds was set up by Bridgend couple Kevin and Carol Richards and has raised almost £500,000 in the last three years.
They insist it is offering a safe and effective alternative therapy for veterans.
But on the programme some describe feeling even worse after a three-day residential course during which veterans are sent to a hotel overnight.
One veteran, who did not want to be identified, said the course of therapy left him feeling suicidal.
""I did two full days and on the third I left and my wife came to collect me,"" he said. ""When she came through the doors it was such a relief, I was left feeling worse than when I first went into Healing The Wounds.""
The undercover veteran, who does not have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but described suffering some of the  symptoms, was told by Carol Richards during therapy that it had taken her just 20 minutes to help one soldier who had seen many of his colleagues killed.
No attempt was made to contact the undercover veteran's GP to check his physical or mental health before therapy began.
Prof Neil Greenberg, co-director of the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health at Kings College London, said: ""If this group who are not medically qualified and don't know a person's whole treatment history, because they haven't got that, that could cause some real problems, it could be quite dangerous.""
Healing the Wounds said it is collecting data to prove its treatment is effective, but Prof Greenberg says unless NLP is subjected to what are known as randomised clinical trials it cannot be established as an appropriate treatment for PTSD.
He added: ""NLP has not been investigated by proper scientific trials to show it works.
""The key point is, just because someone feels good at end session, there is no guarantee they're going to feel good in the future.
""And given the fact we know psychological therapies have potential to harm we need to do those trails.""
The programme also discovered that regulators have investigated the qualifications of a counsellor who had falsely been described as a clinical psychologist and a paramedic while helping vulnerable veterans for the charity.
John Yandle from Blaenavon claims Healing The Wounds did not check his qualifications before he began counselling people with PTSD who had turned to it for help.
The Health and Care Professions Council which polices the appropriate use of job titles including paramedic and clinical psychologist has ordered him not to use the titles in future.
Mr Yandle, who does have counselling qualifications, denied deliberately misleading people and says the charity had mistakenly referred to him as a paramedic on its website.
Darren Millar, chair of the Welsh assembly's cross-party group on the Armed Forces, is calling for better regulation of charities offering mental health services to veterans.
He said: ""Because there is no regulation anybody can set up as an NLP practitioner and the quality of their work is not monitored by anybody so that puts potential risks out in the field for anybody accessing those sorts of services.""
""What we need is some proper arrangements for oversight of the quality of the work being done by any charity that is giving some support to veterans.
""What is important is to measure the outcomes when any organisation is offering this sort of service to see if it is making a real difference in the lives of the people who contact it.""
The Charities Commission has confirmed it is investigating Healing the Wounds and its links to The Forces Aid Foundation - set up by Kevin Richards and wrongly described as a charity on its website.
Mr Richards thanked the programme for pointing out the error and said it would amend its website.
The Welsh government said it has spent £500,000 on the All Wales Veterans Health and Well Being Service.
A spokesman added: ""We are clear that where any body offers treatment for any condition, they should ensure that these are in line with evidence based guidelines.
""This is a stipulation for the NHS but an expectation for general good practice more broadly.""
Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales on Tuesday, 22 October 2013 at 22:35 BST","Healing the Wounds in Porthcawl has been asked to stop using Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), which tries to change people's patterns of mental and emotional behaviour. It is not regulated and there is no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness. The decision to ask Healing the Wounds to stop using NLP may stem from concerns regarding the potential harm it could cause to individuals seeking help.

One of the main issues surrounding NLP is the lack of regulation. Unlike other therapeutic practices, there are no standardized training or certification requirements for practitioners. Without proper oversight, it becomes difficult to ensure that practitioners are adequately trained and competent in delivering NLP therapy.

Additionally, the effectiveness of NLP has been widely debated within the scientific community. While some individuals may claim to benefit from NLP techniques, there is a lack of rigorous scientific evidence to support its claims. The field of psychology generally relies on evidence-based practices, which require substantial research and empirical support.

It is important to consider the potential risks associated with using unregulated and unproven therapies, especially concerning mental and emotional well-being. In this context, it is understandable that Healing the Wounds has been asked to discontinue the use of NLP in their practice."

"Dr Rebecca Payne said there is a particular problem in north Wales with GPs getting older and fewer younger doctors taking over.
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is launching a recruitment film to trigger a change.
The Welsh government says an extra £10m is being spent on primary care.
RCGP Wales spokeswoman Dr Payne, who teaches medical students at Cardiff University and works as a GP for an out of hours service in north Wales, said it is hard to know exactly how many more GPs are needed in Wales.
""Patients are telling us they are struggling to get appointments and we are working harder and harder,"" she said.
The Welsh government said, overall, GP numbers in Wales have increased by 11% between 2003 and 2013.
But the RCGP reckons more GPs will be needed across the UK as the aging population continues to grow.
Its film aims to ""tackle media stereotypes of general practice as less stimulating and exciting than other medical careers"".
Meanwhile, Health Minister Mark Drakeford has announced that an extra £6m will be spent over the next year to help healthcare professionals and free up GP time look after people with more complex needs. Another £4m will be spent on improving access to community care.
In all, 64 primary care ""clusters"" have been set up across Wales of GP practices working with pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, therapists, nurses and healthcare workers.
They will run a primary care support team to provide locum cover or offer training and advice to manage local service pressures among other things.
""We are shifting focus from hospital-based care to improving population health and community-based care,"" said Mr Drakeford.","Dr Rebecca Payne said there is a particular problem in north Wales with GPs getting older and fewer younger doctors taking over. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is concerned about the potential impact of this trend on the quality and accessibility of primary care services in the region. The RCGP is urging the government and relevant stakeholders to address this issue by implementing strategies to attract and retain more doctors in general practice in north Wales.

According to Dr Payne, the ageing workforce among GPs in the region is resulting in increased workload and burnout among the remaining practitioners. This, coupled with fewer younger doctors entering the field, could lead to a potential crisis in primary care provision.

The RCGP suggests that recruitment efforts should focus on promoting general practice as an attractive career choice for medical students and junior doctors. Additionally, they recommend providing enhanced support, training, and mentorship programs for newly qualified GPs to incentivize them to work in the region.

Addressing the problem of workload is equally important, as excessive job demands can deter doctors from entering or remaining in general practice. The RCGP suggests implementing measures to reduce administrative burdens and improve working conditions for GPs in order to make the profession more appealing.

By proactively addressing the issue and implementing appropriate measures, the RCGP hopes to ensure that the residents of north Wales continue to have access to high-quality primary care services that meet their healthcare needs."
"James Foley was unable to write letters to his family because they were confiscated by his jailers.
Instead he asked another hostage who was about to be released to commit his letter to memory.
When that hostage was freed he dictated the letter to James' mother, Diane.
The family posted the letter on Sunday evening, on a Facebook page they had set up to campaign for James' release.
Earlier they had attended a memorial mass for James in their home town of Rochester, New Hampshire.
James Foley, a freelance journalist was abducted in northern Syria in November 2012, while covering that country's civil war.
Last week, Islamic State militants released a video showing his beheading by a masked man with a British accent.
On Sunday, he British ambassador to the US told CNN that British officials were close to identifying the killer.
Dear Family and Friends,
I remember going to the Mall with Dad, a very long bike ride with Mom. I remember so many great family times that take me away from this prison. Dreams of family and friends take me away and happiness fills my heart.
I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray.
Eighteen of us have been held together in one cell, which has helped me. We have had each other to have endless long conversations about movies, trivia, sports. We have played games made up of scraps found in our cell… we have found ways to play checkers, Chess, and Risk… and have had tournaments of competition, spending some days preparing strategies for the next day's game or lecture. The games and teaching each other have helped the time pass. They have been a huge help. We repeat stories and laugh to break the tension.
I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.
I think a lot about my brothers and sister. I remember playing Werewolf in the dark with Michael and so many other adventures. I think of chasing Mattie and T around the kitchen counter. It makes me happy to think of them. If there is any money left in my bank account, I want it to go to Michael and Matthew. I am so proud of you, Michael and thankful to you for happy childhood memories and to you and Kristie for happy adult ones.
And big John, how I enjoyed visiting you and Cress in Germany. Thank you for welcoming me. I think a lot about RoRo and try to imagine what Jack is like. I hope he has RoRo's personality!
And Mark… so proud of you too Bro. I think of you on the West coast and hope you are doing some snowboarding and camping, I especially remember us going to the Comedy Club in Boston together and our big hug after. The special moments keep me hopeful.
Katie, so very proud of you. You are the strongest and best of us all!! I think of you working so hard, helping people as a nurse. I am so glad we texted just before I was captured. I pray I can come to your wedding…. now I am sounding like Grammy!!
Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita's when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.
Jim","James Foley was unable to write letters to his family because they were confiscated by his jailers. Instead he asked another hostage who was about to be released to commit the letters to his family on his behalf. This hostage agreed and promised to deliver the letters once he was free.

In these letters, James Foley poured his heart out to his family, expressing his love for them and reassuring them of his strength and resilience. He shared stories of his experiences in captivity, the hardships he endured, and the hope he held onto.

Despite the difficult circumstances, Foley remained steadfast in his faith and encouraged his family to stay positive. He urged them to have faith in his safe return and not to lose hope. Each letter expressed his unwavering love and gratitude for their support, while also highlighting his determination to survive.

The letters also served as a source of comfort for Foley's family, as they provided them with a glimpse into his thoughts and emotions during his captivity. They held onto these letters as a cherished connection to their beloved son and brother.

Tragically, James Foley never had the chance to see his family again or deliver those letters personally. He was brutally executed by his captors shortly after confiding his thoughts and feelings in those letters.

Although the letters were never physically received by his family, they continued to hold immense meaning to them, symbolizing their unbroken bond and the indomitable spirit of James Foley. These letters of love and hope became a testament to his bravery and unwavering love for his family, leaving a lasting impact on all those who read his story."
"Industry Body Oil and Gas UK said that less than £1bn was expected to be spent on new projects this year, compared to a typical £8bn per year in the last five years.
Its new 2016 activity survey said this was despite costs dropping.
Oil and Gas UK said exploration remained at an all-time low with no sign of improving.
The survey said the industry's drive to improve efficiency, reduce operating costs and increase production has had ""marked success"".
And success per exploration well drilled in 2015 was the highest for 10 years,
However, the industry body warned if the oil price remains at about $30 for the rest of 2016, more than 40% of all UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil fields were likely to be operating at a loss - deterring further exploration and investment.
The number of fields expected to cease production between 2015 and 2020 has risen by a fifth to more than 100.
Deirdre Michie, Oil and Gas UK's chief executive, said: ""The UKCS is entering a phase of 'super maturity'.
""While the industry's decades of experience provide great depths of knowledge and expertise which can be applied to recover the still significant remaining resource, the report highlights the challenges that the falling oil price poses in our capability to maximise economic recovery of the UK's offshore oil and gas.
""The basin has to compete fiercely in the global market to attract price-constrained capital to the UK.
""A coherent approach by the industry, regulator and government will be critical to boost the industry's competitiveness and its investors' confidence.
""Together we need to transform the basin into a highly competitive, low tax, high activity province, which is attractive to a variety of operators and sustains and supports the important supply chain based here.""
She added: ""We have a huge task ahead but the prize is worth fighting for.""
Oil industry veteran Sir Ian Wood acknowledged the current downturn was ""probably as tough as it gets"" but said it was ""completely wrong"" to think that the North Sea oil industry was finished.
He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We produce about 44 billion barrels and there is a view that there could be another 20 billion to come, so it's almost a third still to come.
""I think that's a bit high but it could be 15 to 16 billion barrels to come, so there's a huge prize out there and it's quite wrong to think that the North Sea is finished. The North Sea will recover.
""I'm prepared to guarantee in the next four or five years we won't perhaps be back to where we were but we will be back to a pretty active, strong industry with a lot of prospects ahead of it.""
There are pleasant surprises for Britain's oil and gas industry from its annual activity survey.
1 Output increased by nearly 10% last year - far more than expected, and after steep declines in recent years. It's expected to rise another 2.3% this year.
2 More than half of exploration wells were successful in 2015 - the best hit rate for 10 years, and with bigger finds than in the previous three years.
3 Cost-cutting was ahead of plan. Whereas falling production and 10% annual inflation for four years had driven up the cost per barrel extracted, the reverse was true with rising production and a sharp cut in industry pricing.
For instance, the cost of the average exploration well fell from £44m to £30m in only one year.
The average cost of producing a barrel of oil from British waters is on track to fall by 42% in only two years.
There. That upbeat list didn't take long. The unpleasant bits for the industry are somewhat less surprising, and the list is rather longer.

A UK government spokesperson said:  ""This government is clear that the broad shoulders of the UK are 100% behind our oil and gas industry and the thousands of workers and families it supports.
""We have established the Oil and Gas Authority to drive greater collaboration and productivity within industry, and announced a radical £1.3bn package of tax measures in the March 2015 Budget to ensure the UKCS remains an attractive destination for investment and safeguard the future of this vital national asset.
""In January this year we announced a further package of measures including another £20m funding for a further round of seismic surveys, and our strategy to maximise economic recovery of the UKCS.
""We look forward to the industry capitalising on this, to deliver efficiencies and make the industry more robust now and for the future.""
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""The North Sea still holds significant potential but this report highlights that further action is needed to encourage investment. Maximising economic recovery from our oil and gas resources will require the appropriate business conditions for investment in exploration, appraisal and development.
""The Scottish government will continue to do all that we can to support the sector. It is clear, however, that the UK government must take urgent action to substantially reduce the headline rate of tax at the March Budget and incentivise exploration. The fiscal regime must not be a barrier to investment and activity in the North Sea.""
Scottish Labour's energy spokesperson Lewis Macdonald said: ""It's unlikely that the North Sea will ever produce the billions in tax revenues it did at its peak, and government has to recognise its importance to jobs and the economy is much greater than its future role as a source of government tax revenues.""
Tommy Campbell, from  the Unite union, said ""the worst may still be yet to come"".
He said: ""It's too late for tens of thousands of workers across the oil and gas sector who have already lost their livelihoods but tens of thousands more are reliant on the next steps of our political leaders and they are desperately looking for commitments and common purpose.""
Lang Banks, from environmental campaigners WWF Scotland, said the report underlined the need for a new approach to North Sea oil and gas.
He said: ""Given the urgent need to address climate change and wean ourselves off of fossil fuels, knee-jerk tax cuts are not the solution to securing a sustainable future of oil and gas workers and the communities that depend upon them.""
Last month, a report by accountancy firm Moore Stephens blamed plunging oil prices for a sharp rise in the number of UK oil and gas companies going bust.
The Scottish and UK governments recently unveiled details of a £250m ""City Deal"" for Aberdeen, which will see them jointly invest in the area.
Separately, the Scottish government promised an extra £254m of investment in key infrastructure projects in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.","Industry Body Oil and Gas UK said that less than £1bn was expected to be spent on new projects this year, compared to a typical £8bn per year in the past. This significant decrease in spending is largely due to the low oil prices and economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The sharp decline in oil prices since the start of the pandemic has had a major impact on the profitability of the oil and gas industry. As a result, many companies have been forced to cut back on new investments and focus on cost-cutting measures to ensure their survival.

Additionally, the ongoing health crisis has created significant economic uncertainties, making companies hesitant to commit to new projects. The lack of clarity around global oil demand and the timing of the economic recovery has made it difficult for companies to justify large-scale investments in new oil and gas projects.

The reduced spending on new projects not only affects the oil and gas industry but also has wider implications for the economy. The energy sector plays a crucial role in job creation and economic growth, and the decrease in investment could lead to job losses and a negative impact on the overall economy.

However, it is important to note that the decrease in spending on new projects is not necessarily reflective of a decline in the overall oil and gas industry. Many companies are still actively producing and operating existing assets, and the industry continues to play a significant role in meeting global energy demands.

The future of the oil and gas industry will largely depend on the recovery of oil prices and the global economy. If oil prices rebound and the global economy stabilizes, companies may regain confidence and increase their investments in new projects. However, if oil prices remain low and economic uncertainties persist, the industry may continue to face challenges in terms of new investments and growth."
"Brusthom Ziamani said he fell in with members of al-Muhajiroun - an extremist organisation - after he was ""kicked out"" of home for converting to Islam.
He told jurors he did not disagree with the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby but would not commit such an act himself.
The 19-year-old, of Camberwell, London, denies preparing an act of terrorism.
Mr Ziamani was arrested on a street in east London in August last year carrying a 12in (30cm) knife, a hammer and a black flag in a rucksack, the Old Bailey heard.
He had earlier researched the location of Army cadet bases.
Jurors were also told that he had shown his ex-girlfriend weapons, described one of Fusilier Rigby's killers - Michael Adebolajo - as a ""legend"", and told her he would ""kill soldiers"".
On Thursday, Mr Ziamani told the jury that members of al-Muhajiroun - or ALM - gave him money, clothes and a place to stay after his parents, who are Jehovah's Witnesses, threw him out of the family home when he converted to Islam in early 2014.
""I didn't know anything about them apart from what I saw on TV, that they would go out and give demonstrations to people and cause havoc,"" he said.
""They were really warm to me... I learned a lot from them.""
They invited him to an ALM meeting in the basement of a halal sweet shop in Whitechapel, where the group discussed Gaza, Palestine and Sharia law, he said.
Afterwards, he posted on Facebook: ""Sharia law on its way on our streets. We will implement it, it's part of our religion.""
Asked why he did that, he said: ""I did not believe it. I put it up to fit in with these people. I wanted to show these people I believed what they believed - without them I would be on the streets.""
When he was arrested in June last year on an unrelated matter, police found a ripped up letter in his trouser pocket.
In it, he had written about mounting an attack on a British soldier and expressed the desire to die a martyr, the court heard.
But he told jurors: ""I was ranting and raging about the situation in Muslim countries which was described in these talks.
""I did not believe it at all. I was ranting out of anger.""
Defence lawyer Naeem Mian told jurors: ""It's not illegal to be offensive.
""In fact only recently we saw heads of state in Paris marching to defend the right to be offensive in the wake of that atrocity that happened there.
""We have the right to be offensive.
""We all have the right to have an interest in gore and grisly stuff. We have the right to have undoubtedly repulsive views, some of which he has expressed.""
The lawyer added: ""He is not on trial for the murder of Lee Rigby. He is not on trial for his opinions, as repulsive as you may find them.""
The court was told the defendant had been brought up in south London and went to school in Peckham.
His parents had come to the UK from the Republic of Congo.
He told jurors that he used to be involved in stealing people's credit cards and went to a ""play house"" to have sex with prostitutes.
He also said he had been drawn to become a Muslim after listening to rap music but concealed his conversion from his parents and would tuck his Islamic robe into his trousers when he went home.
The defendant told the court that his parents had found out he was a Muslim only when they had seen pictures of friends in Islamic clothes on his mobile phone.
The trial continues.","Brusthom Ziamani said he fell in with members of al-Muhajiroun - an extremist organisation - after he was ""kicked out"" of home for converting to Islam. He told jurors he was drawn to the group because they seemed to offer him support and a sense of belonging. According to Ziamani, his involvement with al-Muhajiroun began shortly after he converted to Islam at the age of 17.

During his trial, Ziamani admitted to planning a terrorist attack in London. He claimed that he intended to behead a British soldier in a crowded area, inspired by the murders committed by Lee Rigby in 2013.

Ziamani's defense argued that he was a vulnerable teenager who had been radicalized by the extremist ideology of al-Muhajiroun. They suggested that his actions were the result of manipulation and psychological grooming by the group's members.

Ziamani explained that he had been looking for guidance and support after being kicked out of his family home for converting to Islam. He felt isolated and vulnerable, and al-Muhajiroun seemed to offer him a sense of purpose and camaraderie.

The prosecution, however, argued that Ziamani was a determined and committed terrorist who had actively sought out like-minded individuals to carry out his plans. They claimed that he had researched potential targets, acquired weapons, and expressed a strong desire to engage in violent jihad.

Ultimately, Brusthom Ziamani was found guilty of planning a terrorist attack and sentenced to 22 years in prison. The case shed light on the influence of extremist groups on vulnerable individuals and raised discussions about radicalization and the role of support networks in promoting violent ideologies."
"Chris Williamson said it would be ""better to facilitate talks"" between the government and opposition amid ongoing political unrest and violence.
The Labour leader is under pressure to condemn President Nicolas Maduro, after voicing support for him in the past.
Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said concerns of growing ""authoritarianism"" must be addressed.
More than 120 people have died during months of anti-government protests in the country.
Two opposition leaders who boycotted a controversial election to create a new constitutional assembly - denouncing it as an attempt by the government to strengthen its power - were put in a military prison on Tuesday.
A statement from shadow foreign minister Liz McInnes on Monday called on the government of Venezuela to recognise its responsibilities to protect human rights, free speech and the rule of law.
And a spokesman for shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry went further on Thursday, saying President Maduro had to address the international community's legitimate concerns ""about his increasingly authoritarian rule"".
""The election must not be treated as a mandate for further repression and violence,"" he told the Guardian.
Mr Corbyn is currently on holiday and not expected to make any comment until he returns next week.
But Mr Williamson, a close ally of the leader, told BBC Newsnight on Wednesday that ""clearly it can't be right, can it - in a situation where there is a massive crisis in Venezuela - to impose sanctions on the country.""
Under the sanctions, announced on Monday, US firms and individuals are banned from doing business with President Maduro.
""Surely it would be far better to try and bring the sides together, to facilitate talks and to encourage the right wing opposition to stop these protests on the streets,"" Mr Williamson added.
Venezuela's 30 million citizens are suffering shortages of food, basic goods and medicines.
Families of UK diplomatic staff in the oil-rich country have been temporarily withdrawn from the country as anti-government protests continue.
Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan condemned the ""disgraceful regime"", adding: ""If the United Nations were to apply sanctions, we would be part of that.""
Mr Corbyn has previously supported the Venezuelan government under both socialist president Hugo Chavez and his successor Mr Maduro.
As a backbencher Mr Corbyn attended a 2013 vigil following the death of Mr Chavez, hailing him as an ""inspiration to all of us fighting back against austerity and neo-liberal economics in Europe"". He also shared a platform with Mr Maduro in 2006.
Asked whether his political philosophy was closer to President Maduro's or Tony Blair's, Mr Williamson declined to answer but said: ""When a government is doing good things, as they certainly were under Hugo Chavez...that's surely a good thing that we should celebrate.""
But Graham Jones, the Labour MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on Venezuelan, said he expected Mr Corbyn to comment on the situation in the Latin American country when he returns from holiday.
""It's down to each individual what they say and when they say it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
""As far as the party's concerned, you know Liz has made this statement. I think it was published in all the press. I would have gone further and I think more needs to be taken.""
The GMB union said it would continue to support the Venezuelan Solidarity Campaign, a UK-based organisation to which 18 unions are affiliated, as its purpose was to defend the rights of ordinary people.
""We need to see an end to the bloodshed, of course, we need to ensure the government respects human rights, but we must have talking and not more guns,"" the union's general secretary, Tim Roache, told Today.","Chris Williamson said it would be ""better to facilitate talks"" between the government and opposition amid ongoing political unrest and violence. The Labour leader is under pressure to condemn President Chris Williamson, a Labour leader, has suggested that rather than condemning President, it would be more beneficial to support dialogue between the government and opposition. Williamson's statement comes in the midst of continuing political turbulence and violence in an undisclosed country or region. This stance puts pressure on Williamson to break from the customary approach of condemning the President and instead advocate for peaceful negotiations."
"Activists are calling for more female participation in politics and working life.
Only 14% of all MPs in the last parliament were women, and almost half of Turkey's cities have no female representation.
Only 28% of Turkish women participate in the workforce, compared with the European Union average of 63%.
Meanwhile Turkey ranks 125 out of 140 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2014, published by the World Economic Forum.
And in recent months, the country has been shaken by news of women being murdered, prompting calls to do more to tackle gender-based violence.
More than 100 women have been killed by men in Turkey since the beginning of this year, local media report. Figures show that the murders of women have been rising for the last three years.
The rise in murders is also symptomatic of a wider problem with domestic and sexual violence.
Turkey made no progress in reducing domestic violence between 2008 and 2014, according to the Domestic Violence Against Women Report 2014 (in Turkish).
The report said almost 40% of women in Turkey had been physically abused at least once in their lifetime. One in 10 had been also subjected to sexual violence by their partner, it added.
Gulsum Kav, from the campaign group We Will Stop Murders of Women, says that politicians - overwhelmingly male - are dragging their feet on pressing issues.
""The laws to protect women are in place but they are not implemented,"" she told the BBC.
""Police and the judiciary are resisting and there is no real political will in Turkey to put pressure on them.""
Recent statements made by leading male politicians have also raised doubts about their commitment to improving women's rights in Turkey.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked anger last year when he said ""women and men are not equal"". Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu also suggested that the best career option for women was motherhood.
Meanwhile, the debate about Muslim headscarves has long been a touchstone for women's rights in Turkey.
Some argue that the government's lifting of a ban on wearing headscarves in state institutions in 2013 has given women more freedom.
Leyla Sahin Usta, who wears a headscarf and is running for parliament for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), says the move changed her life.
""I was kicked out of the medical school because of my headscarf and could only complete my studies abroad. After the ban was lifted, women with headscarves were reborn,"" she said.
""We became equal with other women in Turkey and have the same employment opportunities.""
Activists say having more women in politics would help resolve many of the questions around gender equality.
""In a country like Turkey where women face many problems, it is essential that they have strong representation in parliament to address the inequalities they suffer on a daily basis,"" Gonul Kahraman, chair of the Association for Support of Women Candidates (KA-DER), told the BBC.
KA-DER predicts that women's representation could increase to around 18% in the next parliament, which it says is far from adequate.
Filiz Kerestecioglu, a parliamentary candidate with the pro-Kurdish, leftist People's Democratic Party, says Turkey has seen enough of male politics and she wants to become an MP to ensure that laws to protect women are implemented effectively.
""The current political discourse is encouraging men to be violent against women,"" she says.
""It would be impossible to eradicate the dominant mindset instantly, but I believe we will have bigger gains if there are more women in the assembly.""

Only 14% of all MPs in the last parliament were women, and almost half of Turkey's cities have no female representatives in local governments. This lack of female representation not only undermines gender equality but also hinders the development and progress of societies.

Advocates argue that increasing female participation in politics and working life has numerous benefits. First and foremost, it contributes to a more inclusive and democratic society, as all segments of society should have a say in decision-making processes. Women bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table, which can lead to better policy outcomes that are more representative of societal needs.

Moreover, research consistently shows that gender-diverse teams make better decisions. Including more women in politics and working life can lead to more effective governance and better business performance. Women often emphasize collaboration, compromise, and consensus-building, which are crucial skills in navigating complex challenges and achieving sustainable solutions.

Furthermore, promoting gender equality in politics and working life can serve as a powerful tool for societal development. Studies suggest that higher female political representation correlates with improved social policies, such as increased investment in healthcare, education, and social welfare. Similarly, workplaces that prioritize gender equality tend to have higher job satisfaction, productivity, and innovation.

To achieve greater female participation, various measures can be taken. Political parties can adopt quotas or voluntary targets to ensure a minimum percentage of female candidates for elections. These measures have been successful in countries like Rwanda and Iceland, where female representation in politics is significantly higher compared to the global average.

Additionally, governments can implement policies that promote work-life balance, affordable childcare, and equal pay, making it easier for women to participate in politics and the workforce. Encouraging women to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields through educational initiatives, mentorship programs, and affirmative action can also help address the gender gap.

However, increasing female participation requires a comprehensive approach that challenges deep-rooted societal norms and biases. It calls for changing attitudes, promoting women's empowerment, and fostering a supportive environment that allows women to thrive in their chosen fields.

In conclusion, activists rightly demand more female participation in politics and working life. By promoting gender equality, societies can ensure fair and representative decision-making processes, enhance economic and social development, and foster inclusive and prosperous communities."
"A consultant with France's RMC radio, Fernandez, 55, is expected in Conakry in the next few days, to sign his contract and conduct his first news conference.
The Guinea Football Federation (FGF) has been looking for a replacement since Dussuyer quit as Guinea coach following their quarter-final exit from the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.
BBC Sport understands that Fernandez, who managed Israel between 2010 and 2011, has been picked as the new Syli Nationale coach by the FGF.
Fernandez played 60 times for France and was a member of the side that won the 1984 European Championship title.
He also coached Paris Saint-Germain to the 1996 Cup Winners' Cup but his time in charge of Israel's national team was not so successful.
Fernandez was appointed in May 2010 to lead Israel in the Euro 2012 qualifiers but ended with a record of five wins, a draw and four losses in qualifying group F, eight points behind winners Greece.
The Frenchman also came in for a barrage of criticism from local media for failing to establish a stable squad and made frequent and unorthodox changes to his line-ups.
The much-travelled, vastly-experienced Fernandez has previously managed Spanish clubs Athletic Bilbao, Espanyol and Real Betis.
His managerial journey includes stints with Israeli club Beitar Jerusalem, Qatar's side Al-Rayyan and French club Reims.","A consultant with France's RMC radio, Fernandez, 55, is expected in Conakry in the next few days, to sign his contract and conduct his first news conference. The Guinea Football Association (FEGUIFOOT) announced that they have hired Fernandez as their new national team coach. He will be responsible for leading the team in various international competitions, including the Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers.

Fernandez brings with him a wealth of experience, having coached several football clubs in France and abroad. He is known for his tactical knowledge and ability to build cohesive teams. His appointment is seen as a step towards strengthening Guinea's national football program and achieving success on the international stage.

The FEGUIFOOT president expressed his excitement about Fernandez's arrival, stating that they believe his expertise will greatly benefit the team. They have high hopes that under his guidance, Guinea will be able to compete with some of the best teams in Africa and potentially qualify for the World Cup.

Fernandez is expected to meet with the players upon his arrival in Conakry and begin preparations for upcoming matches. He will have a short time to evaluate the current squad and make any necessary changes or additions before their next fixture.

The news of Fernandez's appointment has generated excitement and optimism among Guinean football fans. They hope that his arrival will bring a fresh perspective and a new era of success for the national team.

"Kevin Prictor's wife Karen and Margaret Rivers have admitted taking £200,000 from the North Wiltshire and District Minor League.
The court heard the Prictors took trips abroad including a 10-day holiday in Florida, which cost more than £7,000.
Mr Prictor, from Swindon, denies a charge of possessing criminal property.
The youth league is one of the country's largest, with 360 teams of seven to 18 year olds competing across 40 divisions.
Between 2009 and 2013, more than £196,000 was deposited or transferred into the Prictors' joint account by league treasurer Karen Prictor, Swindon Crown Court has heard.
Over that period, the couple - with a joint income of between £36,000 and £44,000 - ""lived like kings"", travelling to Florida, New York and Spain and buying televisions, white goods and computers.
While Karen Prictor and the league's secretary Rivers admit fraud, and Rivers's husband Andrew admits possessing criminal property, Mr Prictor denies any wrongdoing.
Hannah Squire, prosecuting, told the court: ""We are not talking about small amounts, these are large chunks of money.
""Kevin Prictor benefited from his wife's fraud; not the odd meal out or gift, but by thousands of pounds.""
She said Mr Prictor, of Beverly, Toothill, had been ""one of the main beneficiaries"" and dismissed his claims that ""he had no interest in family finances"" and ""asked no questions"".
""Nobody is that daft or unquestioning about family finances,"" she said.
""It took a household to spend this money: the shopping, the holidays, the cash.""
The trial continues.","Kevin Prictor's wife Karen and Margaret Rivers have admitted taking £200,000 from the North Wiltshire and District Minor League. The court heard the Prictors took trips abroad including a 10-day luxury cruise as well as purchasing expensive jewelry and a new car with the stolen funds. The couple used their positions within the league to manipulate financial records and divert funds into their personal accounts over a period of five years. The theft was discovered when an audit revealed discrepancies in the league's accounts, leading to an investigation and subsequent charges against the Prictors. The court has ordered the couple to repay the stolen funds and sentenced them to six years in prison for their crimes."
"He said some shows now neglect traditional storytelling for the sake of ""gratuitous"" use of CGI graphics.
The 84-year-old, who was a fixture on Jackanory from the 1960s to '90s, said: ""You can't help but notice how children's TV has changed"".
Cribbins is returning to the genre in the new Cbeebies show Old Jack's Boat.
He said the series, which starts on Monday, has ""a very nice balance"" between traditional storytelling and animation.
But of other children's programmes, he said: ""It's all very fast and noisy now I think.
""You think of the gentleness of Jackanory, somebody would walk onto the set, sit down and say 'hello I'm going to tell you about Ratty and Mole and the Wind in the Willows' and off you went.
""Nice and gentle, and the only thing you saw, apart from the guy or lady talking to you, was a few captions and illustrations, which were stills. That was how it used to be. Pure, simple storytelling.
""Now there seems to be - sometimes, not always - a tendency to use every single opportunity to put in CGI and animation and a lot of it is, I think, gratuitous when the story is actually doing the work for you.
""I think we've got a very nice balance with Old Jack's Boat of story and little bits and pieces [of animation] as well.""
Old Jack's Boat was co-written by former Doctor Who scribe Russell T Davies and features ex-Doctor Who actress Freema Agyeman.
Cribbins is also known for playing Wilfred Mott in Doctor Who as well as for roles in Coronation Street, Last of the Summer Wine and Worzel Gummidge.
He holds the record for the most Jackanory appearances - 111 in total - and played station porter Albert Perks in classic 1970 film The Railway Children.","He said some shows now neglect traditional storytelling for the sake of ""gratuitous"" use of CGI graphics. The 84-year-old, who was a fixture on Jackanory from the 1960s to '90s, believes that this focus on CGI can distract from the essence of a good story.

""Nowadays, it seems like the priority is all about the flashy visuals and special effects,"" he said. ""Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the advancement in technology and what it allows us to create on screen, but sometimes it feels like the story takes a backseat.""

He reminisced about the time when storytelling was at the forefront of television shows. He believes that captivating storytelling has the power to engage and entertain viewers more than any amount of CGI spectacle.

""I remember when Jackanory was all about bringing stories to life through the power of words and imagination,"" he said. ""It was simple yet incredibly effective. The audience would be captivated by the storyteller's voice and the story itself, without needing flashy visuals to keep them hooked.""

He acknowledged that there are some modern shows that strike a balance between CGI and storytelling, but he worries that many others have lost sight of the importance of a well-crafted narrative.

""Of course, there are exceptions to this trend, and there are shows that manage to incorporate CGI while still maintaining a strong focus on storytelling,"" he explained. ""But overall, I think some shows are missing out on the magic of traditional storytelling by relying too heavily on CGI graphics.""

The veteran storyteller also emphasized the potential impact of storytelling on young minds and the importance of maintaining the art.

""Storytelling is a valuable tool for engaging children's imaginations and fostering a love for reading and storytelling,"" he said. ""It's important to not let the glitz and glamour of CGI overshadow the beauty of a well-told story. We should continue to nurture and celebrate the art of storytelling for future generations.""

"Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting.
They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve ""political expenditures"" of up to £1m which support the movement's objectives.
Last year the Co-op Group gave £625,000 to the Co-op Party.
This figure was down on the sums donated in previous years.
The AGM also included a vote on new corporate governance procedures which would mean members having less of a direct say.
The Co-operative Group is still recovering from a period of financial mismanagement and some members have recently expressed concerns about how elections to the board are chosen.
The banking arm of the group came close to collapse in 2013, bringing the whole group to a £2.5bn annual loss that year.
The Co-op Party includes among its members a number of Labour MPs, including shadow chancellor Chris Leslie and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy.
The politicians stand as candidates of both the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party, and the two political movements have strong historical ties.
The board asked the members of the Co-operative Group whether they wanted to continue financially supporting the Co-operative Party, or any other party.
Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-op Group, said: ""There's a clear remit from the members to continue to support the Labour Party.
""It allows us to now have a conversation with the Co-op Labour Party about what we do next.""
There was also a members' motion on the agenda, put forward by those in favour of making political donations of up to £1m a year.
The motion to approve political funding ""not to exceed £1m per annum"" was carried by 55.17% to 44.83%.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said: ""To meet a £1.5bn hole in its accounts - mostly stemming from its banking division - the Co-op Group has had to sell off parts of its businesses and hand over majority control of its bank to American hedge funds.
""It's also in the process of radically changing the way it runs itself into a more corporate structure with less of a direct say by its members.""
He said that ""in theory"", each of the 2.8 million Co-op members could vote on a series of motions about the reforms, as well as how its bosses are paid, and retaining the links to the Co-operative party.
One of the group's largest independent societies, Midcounties, recently threatened legal action over a shortlist of six candidates for the group's board being reduced to three - the number of positions available - before a member vote.","Members of the group, the UK's biggest mutual organisation, voted on the issue at their annual general meeting. They passed a motion by 48,579 for, to 39,479 against, to approve the proposed changes to the organization's constitution.

The approved changes to the constitution might entail various modifications and updates to the organization's rules and regulations. These could include adjustments to the membership criteria, governance structure, decision-making processes, or any other relevant aspect.

As the UK's biggest mutual organisation, this vote result emphasizes that a significant portion of the membership is in agreement with the proposed changes. It also showcases the democratic nature of the organization, illustrating that the members have a say in shaping its future.

With the motion now approved, the organization can proceed with implementing the changes and adapting its operations accordingly. This might involve updating internal systems, communicating the modifications to members, and ensuring appropriate steps are taken to uphold the new constitution.

It is crucial for the organization's leadership to consider the viewpoints of both those in favor and those against the motion. Even though the majority voted in favor, understanding the concerns raised by dissenting members can aid in maintaining transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.

Overall, this voting outcome signifies an important milestone for the organization, as it moves forward with the support of the majority to enact changes in line with its members' preferences."

The experts said ""trigger"" events like last June's referendum result are known to lead to a spike in incidents.
Hate crime recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% in the month after the vote to quit the EU.
Last July, the UK government published a plan to deal with hate crime in England and Wales in a bid to increase reporting of incidents and improving support for victims as well as reducing the scale of the problem.
Prof Matthew Williams, from the university's Social Data Science Lab, said: ""The referendum on the UK's future in the European Union has galvanised certain prejudiced opinions held by a minority of people, resulting in a spate of hate crimes.
""Over the coming period of uncertainty relating to the form of the UK's exit, decision makers, particularly those responsible for minimising the risk of social disorder through community reassurance, local policing and online governance, will require near real-time information on the likelihood of escalation of hateful content spread on social media.""
Hate crimes in Wales were up 60% over the EU referendum vote period compared with the same time the previous year.

The experts said ""trigger"" events like last June's referendum result are likely to generate an increase in hate speech and misinformation on social media platforms. These trigger events can lead to social unrest and conflicts, making it crucial for authorities to quickly identify and address these issues.

The monitoring tool being developed will utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to identify and flag suspicious content on platforms like Twitter. It will be programmed to recognize hate speech, misinformation, and any content that incites violence or promotes illegal activities.

The tool will provide real-time monitoring and alert authorities whenever potential threats are detected. This will allow them to take prompt action and prevent the spread of harmful content. Additionally, it will assist in providing valuable data and insights into the patterns and trends of hate speech to develop more effective strategies in tackling online hate.

By deploying this monitoring tool, the aim is to create a safer online environment and hold accountable those who misuse social media platforms to spread hate and misinformation. It will enable police and government officials to identify individuals and groups involved in such activities and take appropriate legal measures against them.

Some residents claim people are feeding the boar which encourages the animals into towns and villages.
West Dean Parish Council said it has formed an action committee.
Tim Gwilliam, district and parish councillor for Berry Hill, said culls are not working.
He said: ""Perhaps it's the tactics that need addressing. We need to put it right.
""There is nothing worse than somebody's grave being turned over. It's horrendous. It's 2017 and we can't allow this to happen.""

Despite years of culling, the last count put the number of boar in the region at nearly 1,600 - more than 500 up on the year before.
The target population for the Forestry Commission is 400.
Wild boars were hunted to extinction in England in the 17th century, but 12 years ago about 60 farmed animals were illegally dumped in the Forest of Dean.

Blond or leucistic hedgehogs are usually only found on Alderney in the Channel Islands where they became common after a pair were released in the 1960s.
Their creamy-coloured spines are caused by a rare recessive gene.","The unusual hog, named Burt, was admitted to the Secret World Wildlife Rescue at the end of September. Burt, who was treated for ringworm, was due to be released in early November. However, during his stay at the rescue, Burt managed to captivate the hearts of the staff and volunteers with his unique personality.

Unlike other hogs, Burt had a mischievous demeanor and a playful nature. He had a knack for finding hidden treats and would often be seen rolling around in the mud, happily snorting and grunting. His antics brought a smile to everyone's face, making him the unofficial mascot of the rescue.

As Burt's release date approached, the staff couldn't bear to say goodbye. They had grown fond of his spirited presence and knew that he would be missed dearly. In a surprising turn of events, they decided to extend his stay at the rescue indefinitely.

Word spread quickly about Burt's extended residency, and visitors started flocking to the rescue to catch a glimpse of the extraordinary hog. His charm was contagious, and people couldn't resist spending time with him. Burt became a local celebrity, attracting attention from all around the region.

The rescue decided to capitalize on Burt's popularity and used his story to raise awareness about conservation efforts for threatened species like hedgehogs. They organized educational workshops, where people could learn about hog conservation and even interact with Burt,"

"The new rates will range between 5% and 28% depending on the product, with 12% and 18% as the standard.
The long-awaited changes aim to streamline the country's fragmented tax system and transform it into a single market.
Currently, everything sold in India is subject to a multitude of taxes varying from state to state.
Indian businesses have been lobbying for the countrywide tax rates as the reform is expected to reduce costs, particularly for shipping goods across state borders.
The country's finance minister Arun Jaitley described the tax reform as ""transformative"", telling the BBC it would increase efficiency and tax compliance as well as bringing in additional revenue.
It would also allow a ""seamless transfer of goods and services across the country,"" Mr Jaitley said.
The changes mark a ""significant development"", said Santosh Dalvi of KPMG in India.
There has been no announcement yet, though, of which products fall into which of the tax categories.
""While one can have some guesswork around the GST rate for some of the products, the devil is in the detail when the final classification list will be released which is the most challenging task for the policy makers,"" said Mr Dalvi.
According to Mr Jaitley, half of the items in the consumer price index would not be taxed at all to protect the poor.
The index is a basket of consumer goods and services used to measure changing prices and inflation.
A central plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic agenda, the centralised tax is intended to cut through the red tape and corruption generated by the swathe of state taxes currently in force.
Currently, goods brought for example from the northern city of Haryana to Chennai are taxed in six different states.
With every state deciding its own taxes, it also encourages local protectionism.
Optimistic estimates suggest the changes could bring more than 2% of added economic growth.
India already has overtaken China as the world's fastest growing economy.","The new rates will range between 5% and 28% depending on the product, with 12% and 18% as the standard. The long-awaited changes aim to streamline the country's fragmented tax system and make it more transparent and efficient.

The new rates will ensure simplicity and uniformity across different products and services. This will help businesses and consumers better understand and manage their tax obligations.

For products with a higher rate of 28%, it is mainly aimed at luxury goods and items that are not considered essential for basic needs. This will help discourage excessive consumption and focus on sustainable and responsible purchasing.

On the other hand, the lower rate of 5% will apply to essential goods and services that are necessary for daily life, such as basic food items and healthcare. This aims to provide relief to lower-income individuals and ensure that they can afford basic necessities.

The standard rates of 12% and 18% will apply to most other goods and services, striking a balance between revenue generation and affordability.

Overall, these changes in the tax system are expected to simplify compliance processes, reduce tax evasion, and promote economic growth by creating a level playing field for businesses and consumers alike."

"Ben Emmerson QC, for Mr Litvinenko's family, said in his closing statement that Russian state responsibility had been proven ""beyond reasonable doubt"".
Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina said she believed her husband's ""murderers and their paymasters"" had ""been unmasked"".
But the Kremlin told the BBC it did not trust the inquiry.
Dissident Mr Litvinenko, 43, drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive polonium during a meeting with suspects Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi in London in 2006.
The Kremlin wanted Mr Litvinenko dead and provided the poison used to kill him, Mr Emmerson alleged.
Scientific evidence proves Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi killed the former spy, he added.
Mr Emmerson told the inquiry Mr Putin was an ""increasingly isolated tinpot despot"" and a ""morally deranged authoritarian"".
He said the Russian president and his allies are ""directly implicated in organised crime"".
Mr Putin's ""personal cabal"" are ""willing to murder those who stand in their way"", Mr Emmerson added.
He said: ""If the Russian state is responsible, Vladimir Putin is responsible.
""Not on some analogical version of vicarious liability but because he personally ordered the liquidation of an enemy who was bent on exposing him and his cronies.""
The QC said Mr Kovtun had failed to appear before the inquiry because he would be unable to explain the evidence against him.
Mr Kovtun said in March that he wanted to testify, but failed to appear by videolink.
Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the closing statements, Mrs Litvinenko said she believed ""the truth has finally been uncovered"".
She said her husband had ""vowed to expose corruption"" in the Russian Federal Security Service and the ""highest echelons of power in Russia"".
""His actions were perceived as treachery and he paid the ultimate price for them,"" she said.
Mrs Litvinenko added: ""Any reasonable person who looks at the evidence presented in the inquiry will see my husband was killed by agents of the Russian state in the first ever act of nuclear terrorism in the streets of London.
""This could not have happened without knowledge and consent of Mr Putin.""
The Kremlin said the accusations raised at the inquiry had been heard before.
A spokesman said: ""Such statements were made without any results from the investigation, and after there were results of some sort of investigation.
""It seems they had to add something, so that their words could seem convincing.""
He said officials in Russia ""don't want to have anything to do"" with British investigations into the death.
Mr Lugovoi said the inquiry had been ""biased"".
""These proceedings have long since stopped being of interest to me, since I understood a long time ago that they are biased and politicised,"" he told Interfax.
Inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen will now consider the evidence heard over the last six months.
He is expected to report back to the home secretary by the end of the year.

Germany took an early lead through a stunning long-range strike from Kroos, and Gomez doubled their advantage with a close-range finish. However, England fought back and managed to equalize before halftime, with Kane scoring from a tight angle and Vardy tapping in a rebound.

"Gary Burnett, who played for Northwich Victoria, said he suffered whiplash in a crash outside a McDonald's drive-thru in Birkenhead in October 2013.
But the day after claiming he was injured, he tweeted: ""Nice little trek to Kendal later for footy"".
He was given four months, suspended for a year, for being in contempt of court.
The striker's tweets alerted motor insurers, who began an investigation which led to him being found in contempt of court for making false statements in personal injury proceedings.
Window cleaner Burnett of Lowton, Cheshire, did not think for one moment that he would be ""rumbled"" over his false claim, said Mr Justice Jay at the High Court in London.
The 25-year-old, once on the books of Wigan Athletic, had also boasted about playing and scoring in the FA Trophy less than three weeks after the accident.
Burnett's lawyer, Trevor Parry-Jones, said his ""naive"" client's footballing abilities were far greater than his ""intellectual awareness of life"".
""He has done everything that an investigator for an insurance company would wish a false claimant to do,"" Mr Parry-Jones added.
Burnett, who maintained he had suffered a genuine injury but acknowledged it was nowhere near as severe as he had claimed, admitted he was in contempt of court and made an abject apology.
He was ordered to pay Â£500 costs in addition to Â£11,000 to insurer Aviva after his damages claim was ruled fundamentally dishonest in July 2015.
Burnett now plays for National League North side Curzon Ashton in the sixth tier of English football.","Gary Burnett, who played for Northwich Victoria, said he suffered whiplash in a crash outside a McDonald's drive-thru in Birkenhead in October 2013. But the day after claiming he was in too much pain to play football, he was spotted playing a full 90-minute match for a different team.

Burnett's claim of suffering whiplash in the accident came into question after his quick return to playing football. He had previously stated that the pain was too severe for him to participate in any physical activities, including the sport he loved. However, the following day after making these claims, he was seen playing a full game for a different team, casting doubt on the severity of his injuries.

This inconsistency raised concerns about the legitimacy of Burnett's claims and led to speculation that he might have been exaggerating his injuries for financial gain. Whiplash claims often result in financial compensation, so it is possible that Burnett was attempting to take advantage of the situation.

Despite these doubts, it is important to note that this information is based on reports and speculation. There is no solid evidence to confirm whether Burnett's claims were fraudulent or if there were other mitigating factors that allowed him to play football while still recovering from the accident."
"He gained a reputation as a persistent, often waspish, interrogator whose withering putdowns became a feature of his time in Parliament.
A practising Jew, he was best known for his fierce opposition to the policies of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinians.
Possessed of a sardonic wit, he was a prolific writer and columnist who also wrote satirical sketches for the BBC, an organisation that he later frequently criticised.
Gerald Bernard Kaufman was born in Leeds on 21 June 1930, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants.
A scholarship took him to the fee-paying Leeds Grammar School, and he won an Exhibition to Queens College, Oxford, from where he graduated with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.
While at Oxford he immersed himself in politics and, as the secretary of the University Labour Club, he was instrumental in preventing a student named Rupert Murdoch from standing for office, after the Australian was found to be breaking the rules by canvassing for the position.
On leaving university he set out to find a parliamentary seat. After a brief spell as assistant secretary of the Fabian Society, he was selected to fight Bromley in the 1955 general election. He was roundly defeated by the Conservative candidate, the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.
Four years later he failed at Gillingham, another safe Conservative seat where the Labour vote actually fell.
He had secured a job on the Daily Mirror, where he often wrote leaders. In 1964 he moved to the New Statesman for a short time before working for the Labour Party as a press officer, in which post he became a member of one of Prime Minister Harold Wilson's so-called ""kitchen cabinet"".
It was while visiting his mother in Leeds in November 1962 that he saw the first episode of the BBC's satirical programme That Was the Week That Was. Back in his Daily Mirror office, he phoned the producer, Ned Sherrin, and told him he had an idea for a sketch.
""He had no idea who I was,"" Kaufman later recalled, ""but he said, 'Write it and I'll send a taxi in the morning to pick it up.'""
It led to Kaufman becoming a regular contributor to the show, best known for his Silent Men of Westminster, a satire on MPs who never spoke in the House.
Labour lost the 1970 general election, but Kaufman finally got into Parliament as the member for Manchester Ardwick. When Labour returned to power in 1974 he held junior ministerial posts in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Industry.
He became shadow environment secretary in 1980 and, three years later when his Ardwick seat disappeared in boundary changes, he moved to Manchester Gorton, becoming shadow home secretary after Margaret Thatcher won the 1983 election.
Kaufman was scathing about Labour's move to the left. He accused Tony Benn of nearly destroying the party when he stood as deputy leader in 1981. He later said he would have quit Parliament had Benn been successful.
He was equally critical of Michael Foot's leadership and famously described Labour's 1983 manifesto, which advocated, among other things, unilateral nuclear disarmament and renationalisation of recently privatised industries, as ""the longest suicide note in history"".
After a term as shadow foreign secretary, he returned to the back benches in 1992 and became chairman of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
There he was able to indulge in a series of attacks on what he called cultural elitism. His savaging of Mary Allen, then chief executive of the Royal Opera House, over her failure to account for spiralling costs, saw her resign her position.
The satirical TV puppet show, Spitting Image, lampooned Kaufman as the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, from The Silence of the Lambs.
He became notable for harsh criticism of BBC management and called for the BBC to be privatised, claiming that the corporation could be funded by big business.
He also castigated the BBC over its apology for the obscene calls made by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand to the actor Andrew Sachs, saying that it was ""not enough"".
Kaufman's most vocal attacks were reserved for Israel and its policies towards the Palestinians. A member of the Jewish Labour Movement, he called for economic sanctions against Israel and a ban on sales of arms.
In 2002 he broke a longstanding pledge never to visit Israel when he went there to make a BBC documentary called The End of An Affair, which charted his early infatuation with the Jewish state as a young student and how he later became disillusioned.
He launched a bitter attack on the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. ""It is time to remind Sharon,"" he said, ""that the Star of David belongs to all Jews, not to his repulsive government.""
He often compared Israel's treatment of the Palestinians with South African apartheid and, described Israel's use of white phosphorus flares in the 2009 offensive in Gaza as ""war crimes"".
""I long ago gave up hope for the Israelis participating in a negotiated solution,"" he said in 2014.
Kaufman himself came under fire when the Daily Telegraph published its investigation into MPs' expenses in 2009. It emerged he had claimed more than Â£115,000 for work on his London flat and spent Â£8,000 on a large-screen TV and another Â£1,500 on a luxury rug.
Following the general election of May 2015, he became Father of the House, a title bestowed on the sitting MP who is not a minister who has the longest unbroken period of service in the House of Commons.
A prolific author, he wrote a number of books on the art and practice of politics.
Kaufman was not a clubbable man and not one to suffer fools either gladly or quietly, something that did not endear him to many of his parliamentary colleagues.
That, along with Labour's almost two decades of opposition, may well explain why a politician with undoubted intellect, and one of the pioneers of the New Labour project, never served in the cabinet of a Labour government.
Gerald Kaufman was knighted in 2004.","He gained a reputation as a persistent, often waspish, interrogator whose withering putdowns became a feature of his time in Parliament. A practising Jew, he was best known for his sharp wit and his ability to verbally dismantle his opponents. Despite his small stature, he commanded a powerful presence and spoke with unwavering confidence. He was a staunch defender of civil liberties and championed causes related to human rights and social justice. His intellect and eloquence made him an influential figure in political debates, and his cutting remarks often left his adversaries speechless. His passion for justice and his commitment to his principles earned him admiration from supporters and respect from even those who disagreed with him. Overall, his reputation as a formidable and formidable interrogator made him a force to be reckoned with in Parliament."
"Trevor Bolton, 78, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, targeted eight boys over 20 years at Carmel College in Oxfordshire.
The former housemaster has been convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault, six counts of indecency with a child, and three other sexual offences.
Victims Peter Gluckstein and Stephen Raynor-Endelman told BBC News they were relieved by the verdicts.
Bolton carried out his crimes against boys aged 11 to 15 between 1968 and 1988.
During the trial, one of the victims said at the time Carmel College was regarded as the world's premier Jewish school.
It was based Mongewell Park in Wallingford, but closed in 1997.
The court heard the housemaster and French teacher lived on site and told the boys they could visit his home when they felt homesick.
Two of his victims have waived their anonymity to speak publicly.
Mr Gluckstein, 56, from London, was abused by Bolton from the age of 11.
He said the teacher would help him with his homework and invite him to his flat, where the sexual abuse would take place.
""I would be screaming inside my head for it to stop, but I would still go back,"" he said.
""I still don't really understand the process, the neediness that meant you go back even though you hated it.""
Carmel College was founded by Rabbi Dr Kopul Rosen in 1948 and closed in 1997
It was originally based at Greenham Common, Berkshire, but moved to Mongewell Park in 1952
During its life the school was attended by about 4,000 students - a third from overseas
A 1973 edition of the Observer described it as ""the Jewish Eton""

Stephen Raynor-Endelman, 53, who is now a composer and lives in Los Angeles, was also groomed by Bolton from the age of 11.
He said: ""I was invited up to sit next to him in the classroom, then we'd have lunch together, and it was kind of an enviable position for the other boys.
""He was man of major importance and a very significant figure of power and authority.""
Bolton will be sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on Friday.","Trevor Bolton, 78, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, targeted eight boys over 20 years at Carmel College in Oxfordshire. The former housemaster has been convicted of 16 counts of indecent assault, six counts of sexual activity with a child, and four counts of child cruelty. Bolton used his position of authority to groom and manipulate the boys, who were aged between 13 and 16 at the time of the abuse. He would use various tactics, including taking them out on trips, providing them with alcohol, and engaging in sexual acts with them. The abuse took place between 1969 and 1989.

Bolton's crimes came to light when one of his victims came forward in 2017, prompting others to also share their experiences. The victims described the long-lasting effects of the abuse, including mental health issues and difficulties forming relationships.

During the trial, it was revealed that Bolton had previously been convicted of indecent assault in the 1980s, but had managed to avoid being struck off the teaching register. This raised concerns about how he was able to continue working with children for several more years.

In sentencing, the judge described Bolton's actions as a gross breach of trust and abuse of power. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life.

The case has brought attention to the issue of child abuse within educational institutions and the need for stronger safeguarding measures. The victims hope that by speaking out, they can encourage other survivors to come forward and seek justice for the abuse they endured."

"Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in April 2015 after accidentally overdosing on drugs she bought online.
She had been studying families and childhood studies at Wrexham Glyndwr University.
Ms Parry would have gained a degree but her mother, Fiona, was given a diploma in recognition of work she completed.
An inquest in July 2015 heard how Ms Parry, who had suffered from bulimia, messaged her lecturers apologising for ""being so stupid"".
In the text, she said she had ""screwed up big time"" and ""binged"" on four diet pills, that were later found to contain an industrial chemical called dinitrophenol.
The inquest found she died of an accidental drugs overdose, with the cause given as dinitrophenol toxicity.
The diploma was presented to her mother in a ceremony at the William Aston Hall.
Mrs Parry had described it as ""an awful way to die"" and warned others about the dangers of taking the drug.
She said her daughter was ""a complex and vibrant individual"".
Mrs Parry added: ""Remembering and celebrating her achievements is immensely helpful. It gives her life meaning.""
She also described her daughter's time at university as ""positive"", saying Ms Parry's qualification was going to help her ""follow her dreams"".
Her lecturer Ruth Davies described Ms Parry as ""intelligent, diligent and kind"".
She said: ""She should have been here today celebrating a first class honours degree, which I am certain she would have achieved.""","Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in April 2015 after accidentally overdosing on drugs she bought online. She had been studying families and childhood studies at Wrexham Glyndwr University. Ms Parry had ordered diet pills called DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol) from an illegal website. DNP is a highly toxic substance that is known to cause rapid weight loss, but it can also lead to severe health complications and even death.

Parry took eight of the pills, which contained a lethal dose of DNP. She soon started experiencing a rapid heart rate, increased body temperature, and vomiting. Despite being rushed to the hospital, her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she passed away shortly after.

The tragedy of Eloise Parry's death brought attention to the dangers of purchasing drugs online, especially from unregulated sources. It also highlighted the risks associated with using potentially harmful substances for weight loss purposes.

Authorities have since cracked down on illegal websites selling dangerous drugs, and there have been several prosecutions related to the sale and distribution of DNP. Nonetheless, the incident serves as a reminder of the potential hazards that can arise from the uncontrolled online sale of drugs, and the importance of seeking professional guidance for weight loss or any health-related concerns."
"The standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, is reviewing a draft law replacing the death penalty with life imprisonment for nine crimes, including illegal fundraising and smuggling weapons, the official news agency Xinhua reports.
Praising the move, an article in the Global Times says a ""trend of reducing the use of the death penalty in China is clear"".
It argues that while there is a ""basic social consensus that China should not immediately abolish the death penalty"", the country should ""push toward this direction in a gradual way"".
An editorial in the paper's Chinese edition concedes that the move has led to fears among online commentators that it may lead to more crime, but insists this is unjustified.
""This is only an impression that is not supported by statistics,"" the paper argues.
It adds that phasing out capital punishment is backed by a ""social consensus"" in China as well as a wider global tendency.
""This is a reform and we need to have the courage to move forward,"" it says. ""It would be too timid of us if we were unable to catch up on this aspect of the law.""
The Beijing News predicts that the death penalty will be abolished for further non-violent crimes.
""There are still 46 offences that are punishable by death,"" it says. ""The abolition of the death penalty requires careful planning and China has a long way to go.""
A legal expert interviewed by the Beijing Times says that the number of executions has already fallen to such a degree that capital punishment is effectively restricted to cases of murder, robbery and sexual assault.
The NPC is also reportedly reviewing a draft law to set up a new anti-terrorism intelligence gathering centre.
According to the Global Times, the new body will ""coordinate and streamline intelligence gathering in the field"".
Pan Zhiping , a professor at Xinjiang University's Central Asia Research Centre, tells the South China Morning Post that China's ""intelligence gathering is still lacking, and we need to do more work on that"".
Reports that Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung is seeking Indian co-operation in oil exploration in the South China Sea have raised eyebrows in the Chinese press.
Several media outlets criticise Vietnam for ""inconsistency"" for making the apparent foray just as Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi arrived in Hanoi on Monday for talks to ""push for further co-operation and properly manage maritime disputes"", according to Xinhua.
Ties between China and Vietnam are strained by territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
Anti-China protests erupted in Vietnam in May after Beijing moved an oil rig into waters also claimed by Vietnam. China has since said it has removed the oil rig.
Mr Nguyen reportedly suggested during his visit to Delhi that Vietnam and India may join hands in oil exploration in the area.
An article in the overseas edition of the People's Daily criticises the move, and especially the fact that it coincided with Mr Yang's visit to Hanoi.
""Vietnam's conflicting actions show its government's inconsistency in dealing with Beijing over the South China Sea issue,"" it says, and chides Hanoi for ""thinking that it can contain China with other big countries"".
""Playing tricks will not solve the maritime disputes,"" the paper warns. ""Instead it will hurt the relationship between Beijing and Hanoi and will even delay Vietnam's long-term development. It is time for Vietnam to show its sincerity.""
An analyst tells the Shenzhen Satellite TV the incident is particularly painful after China showed ""goodwill"" to Vietnam by ""retreating"" from the oil rig"".
""The oil rig is in Chinese territory, but China has taken the feelings of Vietnam into consideration.
""As such, Hanoi should sincerely respond to Beijing's goodwill through its actions,"" he argues. ""Instead, it wants to bring India into the picture of territorial dispute.""

The nine crimes covered in the draft law include smuggling cultural relics, smuggling precious metals, smuggling rare animals, smuggling precious plants, smuggling nuclear materials or other radioactive substances, illegal fundraising, financial fraud, organizing prostitution, and manufacturing and selling counterfeit medicines. These crimes were previously punishable by death under specific circumstances in China.

The decision to replace the death penalty with life imprisonment is part of China's ongoing efforts to reform its criminal justice system and reduce reliance on capital punishment. The proposed amendment is in line with the country's goal to ensure fair and proportionate punishment.

By implementing life imprisonment instead of the death penalty for these crimes, China aims to strike a balance between punishment and the protection of human rights. This move reflects the growing global consensus on the need to limit the use of capital punishment and promote alternative forms of punishment that allow for potential rehabilitation and redemption.

However, it is important to note that the draft law is still under review by the standing committee of the NPC and may undergo revisions or amendments before its potential adoption. The decision to replace the death penalty with life imprisonment for these crimes will ultimately depend on the committee's final approval.

If the draft law is passed, it will mark a significant step forward in China's criminal justice system, aligning with international standards and demonstrating the country's commitment to human rights."
"The Scio device was backed by about 13,000 people in a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014.
However, some have complained they are still waiting for their device to be delivered.
Co-founder Dror Sharon told the BBC that 5,000 devices had been shipped.
Mr Sharon has previously described Scio as the first cheap, accessible molecular spectrometer.
It takes an electro-magnetic reading of objects, then compares the result with an online database. It can be used, for example, to distinguish between medicines, or summarise the fat content of a slice of cheese.
During the crowdfunding campaign, backers paid between $150 (Â£115) and $300 for the device, with developer kits costing up to $1,000.
Consumer Physics, the company behind the product, raised $2.7m in the campaign and estimated that devices would be delivered by February 2015.
However, Mr Sharon admitted the firm had experienced delays.
""It has taken more time than we expected,"" he told the BBC.
""We had to design the technology from the ground up, we had to do some redesigns, and we had some issues with suppliers.
""Each bump in the road took weeks to rectify.""
Some backers have expressed concern about the delay on the company's Facebook page, after its crowdfunding page was taken offline.
Visitors are now told the company is facing an ""intellectual property dispute"", but Mr Sharon said the issue was solely concerning the Scio name.
""It has nothing to do with the intellectual property in the sensor or the optics, it's purely a trademark dispute,"" he said.
""But Kickstarter has a very careful policy, they took down the page and put up the note - we tried to reason with them, but they have their policy and we respect that.""
He said the company was continuing to produce the devices, but had chosen to prioritise deliveries to app developers, to speed up the creation of its app ecosystem.
""We've shipped thousands of these little scanners all over the world,"" Mr Sharon told the BBC.
""We decided to start shipping to developers first, which has added some delay for Kickstarter backers who were expecting to get the device very early.
""We realise it's late, but we're doing our best to ship as fast as we can. Between a third to a half of our backers have their device.""","The Scio device was backed by about 13,000 people in a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014. However, some have complained they are still waiting for their device to be delivered. Yes, that is correct. The Scio device, developed by Consumer Physics, gained significant attention and support during its crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in 2014. It raised over $2.7 million with the backing of approximately 13,000 people. However, there have been complaints from some backers who claim they have not received their devices as expected.

Crowdfunding campaigns often face challenges in meeting delivery deadlines due to various reasons such as production issues, manufacturing delays, or unforeseen obstacles. While some backers may have received their Scio devices as promised, there have been reports of delays in fulfilling all the orders.

It's important to note that crowdfunding does come with some level of risk, and backers should be aware that delays and other complications can occur. However, it is advisable for those who haven't received their Scio devices to reach out to Consumer Physics or the campaign organizers for clarification on the status of their order."
"Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide.
He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result.
""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.
Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.
It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda.
Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation.
In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.
Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission ""lacked independence and transparency"", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that ""those Europeans are not serious"".
""Transparency is what we've been voting for,"" he added.
Mr Museveni, a key ally of the West in the campaign against militant Islamists in the region, seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda.
However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian.
On Friday, the US said Mr Museveni should ""rein in"" his security forces after they briefly arrested Mr Besigye, and fired tear gas to disperse his supporters in Kampala.","Mr Besigye was the main challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the country's recent general election, which Mr Museveni won by a landslide. He insists he was the rightful winner despite the overwhelming victory of President Museveni. Mr Besigye has been a prominent figure in Ugandan politics for many years and has previously run for president on multiple occasions.

In the 2021 general election, Mr Besigye's political party, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), challenged the legitimacy of the election results, alleging widespread irregularities and electoral fraud. They claimed that the election was neither free nor fair, pointing to instances of voter intimidation, ballot stuffing, and the prevention of opposition party agents from accessing polling stations.

However, the Ugandan Electoral Commission dismissed these claims and declared President Museveni as the winner with more than 58% of the vote, securing his sixth term in office. The incumbent president has been in power since 1986 and has faced criticism for cracking down on political opposition and restricting democratic space in the country.

Despite the election results, Mr Besigye and his supporters continue to assert that he is the rightful winner and that the election was rigged to favor President Museveni. They have called for an independent investigation into the electoral process and have vowed to keep pushing for political change in Uganda. Nonetheless, the dispute remains unresolved, and President Museveni's victory stands under the current circumstances."

"The two-year-old boy, named in reports as Adam, was discovered lying on the ground in the village of Raclawice, just north of Krakow. He was wearing only pyjamas.
Doctors said on Wednesday he had been brought out of a medically-induced coma and his health was improving.
The boy's grandmother has said she did not see him leave her home.
Police found the boy on Sunday morning lying unconscious near a river, after apparently wandering outside several hours earlier.
The area's temperature had fallen to -7 C (19 F) overnight, the Associated Press reports.
The boy's body temperature was 12 C (54 F) when he arrived at Krakow children's hospital, doctors said, and he was placed in an induced coma.
He was blinking and moving his limbs on Wednesday but was still on a respirator, Janusz Skalski, a heart surgeon at the children's hospital in Krakow, told reporters.
""We're very pleased with his condition... there are no negative symptoms, he's improving,"" AFP news agency quoted him as saying.
Hypothermia expert Dr Tomasz Darocha told Polish media that until now, the most dramatic case of recovery from hypothermia involved a Scandinavian woman whose body temperature had dropped to 13.7 C.","The two-year-old boy, named in reports as Adam, was discovered lying on the ground in the village of Raclawice, just north of Krakow. He was wearing only pyjamas. Doctors said that he was severely malnourished and dehydrated. The child was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment.

Authorities are still trying to determine how the young boy ended up in such a dire situation. They are currently investigating whether there was any neglect or abuse involved.

Social services have been notified and will be working closely with the family to ensure the well-being of the child. The parents are currently being questioned by the police to gather more information about the circumstances leading up to this incident.

Neighbors in the village have expressed shock and disbelief at the news. They claim to have seen the child around but had no idea about the severity of his condition.

Local community members are coming together to support the child and his family during this difficult time. Donations of food, clothing, and other essential items are pouring in to ensure that the child receives the care he needs.

The case has prompted nationwide outrage and calls for stricter child protection measures. 

As of now, the child remains in the hospital under close supervision and is expected to make a full recovery with proper care and support."
"In separate tests in mice and people, empathy towards strangers increased when stress hormones were blocked by a drug.
Playing a fun video game with a stranger was found to have a similar effect to the drug.
The Canadian and American research team published their findings in Current Biology.
Previous studies have shown that the ability to feel or share someone else's pain is not something unique to humans. Mice can feel empathy too.
But in both species, empathy is stronger between those that recognise each other and all but absent between those unfamiliar with each other.
Stress levels have also been shown to rise in both mice and people in the presence of strangers.
In this study, researchers treated mice with a stress-blocking drug and watched their response when confronted with other mice in pain.
They found that the mice became more empathetic and more compassionate to strangers, reacting in a way they would normally react to familiar mice.
When the mice were put under stress, they showed less empathy towards other mice in pain.
Tests in undergraduate students using the same drug showed exactly the same effect, the study said.
They were asked to rate the pain of a friend or stranger whose hand was plunged into ice cold water for 30 seconds.
Students who took the drug reported feeling the pain of a stranger more deeply than those who did not take it.
They also showed more pained facial expressions and touched their own hands more when watching someone else in pain.
Dr Jeffrey Mogil, study author and neuroscientist from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, said his team's findings suggest that the stress system in the brain can have a ""veto"" on our empathy system.
""Yet few people would realise that there is a stress response when you're in a room with a person you don't know,"" he added.
However, he discovered that the key to reducing stress levels quickly was to play a simple ice-breaking game.
In the study, some students who did not know each other played a fun video game which required them to work together to play well-known songs.
""By the time it came to the test, there was no longer any stress,"" Dr Mogil said.
He also said it was intriguing that the impact of stress on empathy appeared to be identical in mice and humans.
""This suggests either that mice are more complicated than we think or that the principle underlying human social interactions is simpler than we think.
""When it comes to social behaviour, mice are people too.""","In separate tests in mice and people, empathy towards strangers increased when stress hormones were blocked by a drug. Playing a fun video game with a stranger was found to increase empathy in both mice and humans when stress hormones were blocked by a drug. The experiments involved administering the drug to the participants before engaging in interactive activities with strangers, such as playing a video game. In these situations, the individuals showed heightened levels of empathy towards their partners compared to those who did not receive the drug. This suggests that stress hormones may play a role in inhibiting empathy towards strangers, and blocking their effects can enhance social connection and empathy."

"Its Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan has been slotted into the vehicle's upper-chassis for the first time.
Engineers need to check the power unit will sit comfortably inside the car with the correct clearances.
The EJ200 is normally seen in a Eurofighter, but Bloodhound will use the engine to help it break the world land speed record (763mph) and then raise the mark beyond 1,000mph.
The project is currently on course to try to achieve the first stage in this double quest at the end of the year.
Major components are in the process of being manufactured with some of the UK's top aerospace companies.
As soon as these parts arrive at Bloodhound's technical centre in Bristol, they are bolted in place.
The UK Ministry of Defence has loaned three EJ200s to the project. These are early development models that have no combat use.
The Rolls-Royce units develop about 20,250 lbf (90 kN / 9 tonnes) with reheat. This on its own, however, is not enough to push Bloodhound into the record books.
The EJ200 will be used to get the car rolling. Once it reaches 350mph, a Jaguar V8 engine will accelerate, a clutch will engage and nearly 1,000 litres of HTP oxidiser will be pumped into a catalyst pack, bringing a rocket on stream.
It is the combined thrust of the EJ200 and this booster - produced by Nammo in Norway - that will propel Bloodhound through the sound barrier and on to speeds never before achieved by a land vehicle.
All of the jet thrust is reacted through a single hollow thrust trunnion (fixing) just 32.5mm in diameter, with a wall thickness of only 3.25mm. The EJ200 hangs from this mounting point.
Although Bloodhound SSC is nearly 13m long, space inside the car is at a premium, and the clearance between the EJ200 and the chassis in some areas is a mere 10mm.
The EJ200 intake cannot cope with an airflow of 1,000mph (1,610km/h). This rush of air could damage its fan blades.
So the car's designers have shaped the car's cockpit to create a series of shockwaves that slow the air down to 600mph (965km/h).
While the jet engine will be comfortable with this, the same may not be true for driver Andy Green. The noise this maelstrom of air makes will be immense.
The car's upper-chassis - which houses the EJ200 - is made from aluminium machined ribs with titanium stringers.
The titanium skin is held together by 11,500 aerospace grade rivets - everyone hand fixed and polished - and also bonded with special glue.
It would be sufficiently strong with either rivets or bonding, but the Bloodhound engineers have combined the two for extra security.
The project expects to have the finished car on the runway at the Newquay aerodrome in Cornwall for shakedown tests in August.
Assuming this goes well, the vehicle will then be shipped to South Africa to begin its record bid using a ""race track"" that has been prepared on Hakskeen Pan, a dried out lakebed in Northern Cape.
Andy Green set the current land speed record in the Thrust SSC vehicle in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, US, in 1997.
The RAF Wing Commander is one of three central figures from that earlier venture working on Bloodhound. The other two are project director Richard Noble, and chief aerodynamicist, Ron Ayers.
Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","Its Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan has been slotted into the vehicle's upper-chassis for the first time. Engineers need to check the power unit will sit comfortably inside the car with the correct clearances and dimensions. They also need to ensure that the turbofan is properly connected to the vehicle's electrical and fuel systems.

To complete these checks, the engineers carefully maneuver the Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan into position within the car's upper-chassis. They pay close attention to aligning it correctly and making sure all necessary connections can be easily made.

Once the power unit is in place, the engineers go through a series of assessments. They measure and verify clearances to ensure the turbofan fits within the allocated space without any interference. This helps prevent any potential damage or performance issues.

Additionally, the engineers inspect the interfaces to ensure all electrical and fuel connections are properly aligned and accessible. They confirm that the turbofan can be easily connected to the necessary electrical circuits and that fuel lines can be connected securely.

During this process, the engineers may also perform computer simulations and stress analyses to assess the power unit's overall performance and its impact on the vehicle's balance and stability. This helps them validate that the turbofan's integration will not negatively affect the car's handling or performance characteristics.

Overall, this meticulous process of checking the power unit's fit and connections is crucial to ensure that the Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan can successfully power the vehicle and function optimally within its upper-chassis."
"Hassan Mohammed, from Camberwell, south London, was stabbed in York Road, Southend-on-Sea on 7 July last year.
Tajwar Alam, 19, of Seaford Road in Tottenham, north London, denied murder but was convicted by a majority verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court in May.
Judge Charles Gratwicke, sentencing him on Friday, said he was a callous young man with a tendency to violence.
He told Alam that he would serve 20 years before parole would be considered.
Mr Mohammed died at Southend Hospital the day after he was stabbed.
Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett said: ""The sentence handed down today will ensure the people of Southend are safe from Alam and hopefully give Hassan's family some closure so they can move on with their lives, although nothing will bring their son back.""

"Burnley defender Ward, 30, injured an ankle in the first half of Wednesday's dramatic 1-0 win over Italy.
The left-back missed training in Versailles on Friday morning.
On the plus side, Stoke striker Walters resumed training with the squad after missing the last two Euro 2016 games because of an Achilles injury.
On Thursday, manager Martin O'Neill said Ward's ankle had ""blown up"" after he picked up the knock in the first half of the game in Lille.
O'Neill is likely to be keen to retain Ward at left-back and allow Wednesday night's goal hero Robbie Brady to be used in the more offensive role he adopted to such good effect against the Italians.
The Republic players were back in training on Friday morning after being given the day off on Thursday.
O'Neill and his players did not get to bed until around 4.30 in the morning on Thursday after travelling back from Lille to their base in Versailles.
Inevitably, the pre-match discussion about Sunday's game in Lyon includes mention of the Republic having the chance to avenge the incident in November 2009, when the Irish missed out on qualification for the World Cup finals in South Africa thanks to a decisive goal that saw Thierry Henry handle the ball in the build-up.
However, O'Neill says the current Republic squad have ""decided to forget about it"".

"But if you don't know the first thing about rugby then fear no more!
We've made you a special guide that will help you bluff your way through conversations and impress your mates during the tournament.
Here is Newsround's top words, phrases and fun facts to try and drop in while you're watching the games.
A game of rugby consists of two halves of 40 minutes.
Each side has 15 players, divided into eight forwards and seven backs.
The forwards are generally bigger and heavier and the backs are faster and smaller.
A total of seven substitutes are allowed for international matches.
There is one referee assisted by two touch judges, who help the referee make decisions.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: ""The forwards are doing all the work out there.""
SCORING
The object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. There are a few different ways to score points:
Try: A try is worth five points. It is scored when a player places the ball on the ground with downward pressure, between the try line and dead ball line of the opposition's half of the pitch.
There is no such thing as an ""own try"". If you touch the ball down in your own in-goal area, it results in a kick or a scrum.
Conversion: If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to ""convert"" it for two further points by kicking the ball through the goal. The kick is taken from a point level with where the try was scored.
Penalty kick: If a side commits a foul or serious offence, a penalty is awarded and the opposition can decide to kick the ball through the goal posts from where the offence happened. If successful, it is worth three points.
Drop goal: A drop goal is also worth three points and is scored when a player kicks the ball from out of their hands through the opposition's goal. But the ball must touch the ground between being dropped and kicked.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: ""Great try boys! Now let's add the conversion.""
KEY WORDS
Scrum - A scrum is when eight forwards from one team push against eight forwards from the opposing team. One player feeds the ball into the middle of the scrum and the two sides then push to try and take control of the ball.
It's used to as a way of restarting the game and can be one of the key areas that help a team win.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: ""That's a messy scrum, they're all over the place.""
Hooker - A key player in the scrum - their job is to hook the ball back towards the rest of their team using their feet.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE:""This guy can't hook for toffee."" (if their team keeps losing the scrum)
Fly-half - Some people think that the fly-half is the most important player on the pitch.
He is normally the best kicker and is in charge of calling plays and controlling where his team go, where they're running and where the ball goes.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: ""He's no Jonny Wilkinson that fly-half.""
Turnover - A turnover is when one side is attacking and the other team take the ball off them.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE:""They've done well to force the turnover.""
Ruck - When a tackled player hits the ground he must let go of the ball. If neither team then picks it up they can start pushing against each other with the ball still on the ground. This is what's known as a ruck.
Teams can push the other back great distances while the ball is in the ruck. However, if it stops moving the referee may blow his whistle and restart the game with a scrum.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: ""They need more people in the ruck.""
Sin-bin - All players who have committed a yellow card offence have to leave the game for 10 minutes and sit on a bench called the sin-bin.
Unlike football, anyone the ref shows a yellow card must leave the pitch straight away, but can come back after their 10-minute punishment runs out.
BLUFFER'S PHRASE: (After a bad tackle) ""He should go to the sin-bin for that.""
Here's some other things you might hear a lot:
Lineout: When the ball goes out of play at the side of the pitch, a lineout is awarded against the team who last touched the ball.  Players from each team line up in a long row and the ball is thrown into this line up by the hooker. Both sides jump to try to get the ball, and can lift each other up to reach it.
Knock-on/knock-forward: This is when the ball goes forward off the hands or arms of a player and hits the ground or another player. You are not allowed to throw the ball forward in rugby and so if there is a knock on the other team are awarded a scrum.
Forward pass: The ball always has to be passed backwards in rugby. If the referee thinks it is passed forward then a scrum is awarded to the other side.
High tackle: It is illegal to tackle an opponent above the shoulders. The same goes for the late tackle - tackling the player after he has passed or kicked the ball.","But if you don't know the first thing about rugby then fear no more! We've made you a special guide that will help you bluff your way through conversations and impress your friends with your newfound rugby knowledge. Whether you're watching a game at a pub or engaging in a rugby-related conversation, these tips will have you sounding like a seasoned rugby fan in no time.

1. Understand the basics: Rugby is a full-contact team sport played with an oval-shaped ball. The objective is to score more points than the opposing team by either scoring tries (touching the ball down in the opponent's in-goal area) or by kicking penalties and conversions (similar to field goals and extra points in American football).

2. Familiarize yourself with the positions: While there are 15 players on each team, it's good to know the key positions. The forwards include the front row (props and hooker), locks, and flankers, who are typically involved in rucks and mauls. The backs include the scrumhalf, flyhalf, centers, wings, and fullback, who are usually involved in attacking moves and running the ball.

3. Know the scoring system: Unlike many other sports, rugby has multiple ways to score. A try is worth 5 points, while a successful conversion after a try adds 2 points. Penalty kicks and drop goals (similar to field goals in football) are worth 3 points each.

4. Understand the game flow: Rugby is played in two 40-minute halves with a short halftime break. The game starts with a kickoff, and teams advance by either running with the ball or kicking it. If a player is tackled, a ruck or maul forms, where players from each team try to gain control of the ball. It's important to act impressed by impressive tackles, slick passes, and fast-paced line breaks.

5. Learn the jargon: Rugby has its own set of terms, so learning a few can help you sound knowledgeable. For example, the ""scrum"" is a way to restart play after minor infringements, while a ""lineout"" is used to restart play after the ball goes out of bounds. Understand terms like ""knock-on"" (when a player loses the ball forward) and ""offside"" (when a player is in an illegal position relative to the ball).

6. Study the teams and players: Familiarize yourself with popular rugby teams and key players to have some talking points. Know some of the current top teams in international rugby, such as New Zealand's All Blacks, England's national team, or South Africa's Springboks. Mentioning star players like Dan Carter, Richie McCaw, or Jonny Wilkinson can also impress rugby enthusiasts.

7. Show enthusiasm and engage: Even if you're bluffing your way through a rugby conversation, showing genuine interest and excitement can go a long way. Ask questions, cheer during exciting moments, and acknowledge players' skills. Remember, the key is to have fun and enjoy the sport with others.

With these tips, you'll be able to confidently navigate rugby conversations and enjoy the sport, even if you're a novice. Good luck bluffing your way to rugby knowledge!"
"Six prominent authors boycotted the event, saying it celebrated the magazine's ""cultural intolerance"".
Islamists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris in January after the magazine published drawings of the Prophet Muhammad.
On Sunday, two gunmen were killed at a draw-the-Prophet competition in Dallas.
PEN president Andrew Solomon said: ""The defence of people murdered for their exercise of free speech is at the heart of what PEN stands for.
""Charlie Hebdo's current staff have persisted, and tonight's award reflects their refusal to accept the curtailment of lawful speech through violence.""
Charlie Hebdo's editor in chief, Gerard Biard and Jean-Baptiste Thoret, a film critic who arrived late for work on the day of the attack, were at the gala to accept the award.
Mr Thoret has rejected any comparison between the Paris and Dallas attacks.
""To be honest, I can imagine the kind of comparison you can make between the Charlie Hebdo attack of January 7 and this event, but there is nothing. There is no comparison, absolutely no comparison,""  he told PBS's Charlie Rose.
The film critic added that the attack in Texas was part on an ""anti-Islamic movement"" in the US.
The decision to award the magazine the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo caused six high-profile authors to withdraw, including The English Patient writer Michael Ondaatje.
They said PEN - known for defending imprisoned writers - was stepping beyond its traditional role.
Authors Peter Carey, Rachel Kushner, Teju Cole, Taiye Selasi and Francine Prose also boycotted the event.
Booker Prize-wining author Mr Carey told the New York Times that the boycotting writers felt PEN's role was to protect freedom of expression against government oppression.
""A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom of speech issue for PEN America to be self-righteous about?"" asked Mr Carey.
""All this is complicated by PEN's seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.""
In addition, more than 100 other writers signed a letter of protest against the award.
The boycott has been criticised by the author Salman Rushdie, a former president of PEN who was in hiding for years over Islamist threats in response to his novel The Satanic Verses.
He said his friends were ""horribly wrong"" and he hoped nobody ever came after them.","Six prominent authors boycotted the event, saying it celebrated the magazine's ""cultural intolerance"". Islamists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris in January after the magazine published drawings of the Prophet Muhammad. The attack resulted in the deaths of 12 people, including eight Charlie Hebdo staff members and two police officers. The incident sparked global outrage and ignited discussions about freedom of speech, radicalism, and religious sensitivities.

In response to the satirical magazine's decision to hold an event marking the attack's anniversary, six prominent authors chose to boycott the event, claiming that it celebrated the magazine's alleged ""cultural intolerance."" These authors believed that Charlie Hebdo's portrayal of Prophet Muhammad in its cartoons was disrespectful and offensive to the Islamic community.

The attack by Islamists on the magazine's offices in January 2015 was a brutal act of violence aimed at suppressing freedom of expression. Critics argue that the decision to publish drawings of Prophet Muhammad not only provoked a violent response but also generated tensions between religious and secular communities.

The authors' decision to boycott the event represents a division in opinions regarding the exercise of free speech and cultural sensitivity. While some argue that freedom of expression should prevail, even if it offends certain religious beliefs, others believe that certain limits should be placed to promote respect and avoid unnecessary provocation.

The Charlie Hebdo attack and the ensuing debates brought attention to the delicate balance between freedom of expression and cultural sensitivities. It also highlighted the importance of promoting dialogue and understanding to bridge the gaps that exist within diverse societies."
"Locals discovered the bodies of the deceased, who were believed to be in their 20s, in a public park in Sonipat.
The bodies, which have not been identified, have been sent for post mortem, police say.
Hundreds are killed each year in India for falling in love or marrying against their families' wishes.
Police said the man's legs had been chopped off and put inside the trunk. The woman was found wearing glass bangles, which are traditionally worn by newly-married women.
""It appears they were strangled and dumped here later. They are yet to be identified,"" senior police officer Praveen Kumar told AFP news agency.
""It seems like a case of honour killing because the woman is wearing wedding bangles but we are not ruling out other motives.""
Monday's incident comes days after the state police arrested a man on suspicion of killing his teenage daughter over her relationship with a boy from another caste.
Most parents in India still prefer arranged marriages within their own caste and relationships outside of the caste are frowned upon.
In 2011, India's Supreme Court said those involved in honour killings should face the death penalty.","Locals discovered the bodies of the deceased, who were believed to be in their 20s, in a public park in Sonipat. The bodies, which have not been identified, have been taken to the local hospital for further examination. The cause of death is yet to be determined, and authorities are currently investigating the incident. The discovery of the bodies has left the community shocked and saddened, as they await more information from the authorities. Further updates will be provided as the investigation unfolds."
"IAG said the new airline, Level, would initially fly to Los Angeles, Oakland, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic from June.
The airline will use Iberia crew and two new Airbus A330 planes.
Willie Walsh, IAG chief executive, said Level would become its fifth airline brand alongside Aer Lingus, BA, Iberia and Vueling.
""Barcelona is Vueling's home base and this will allow customers to connect from Vueling's extensive European network onto Level's long-haul flights,"" he said.
The company will look to offer Level flights from other European cities. ""We're really excited about the opportunities for expansion,"" Mr Walsh added.
Fares start from 99 euros/$149 each way.
Travel writer and broadcaster Simon Calder said the new airline was good news for travellers as more competition would put pressure on fares.
He said IAG's move echoed Lufthansa's decision to offer flights to destinations in the Caribbean and Asia on Eurowings, its low-cost offshoot.
It was also an attempt to counter the challenge posed by low-cost newcomers such as Norwegian Airlines.
As well as operating Boeing 787 services from London Gatwick airport to cities such as Orlando, Las Vegas and New York, Norwegian plans to offer direct flights to the US using smaller Boeing 737 planes from the likes of Belfast and Edinburgh.
Mr Calder said that move would put even more pressure on traditional airlines such as BA and Iberia.
Loizos Heracleous, a professor of strategy at Warwick Business School, said budget airlines had far lower costs than longer-established competitors, meaning they were more profitable.
""IAG's decision to expand with a separate low-cost brand safeguards the image of its flag-carrier brands,"" he said.
""The real trick will be to start Level on as high an efficiency point as possible, this being a crucial factor that distinguishes winners and losers in the budget airline sector.""
Last month IAG reported a 64% jump in annual profits to 1.8bn euros (Â£1.4bn), helped by lower fuel prices.
Shares in IAG were flat at 571.1p on Friday but have risen by almost 30% since the start of the year, valuing the company at more than Â£12bn.","IAG said the new airline, Level, would initially fly to Los Angeles, Oakland, Buenos Aires and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic from June. The airline will use Iberia crew members and two Airbus A330 aircrafts for the initial routes. The decision to use Iberia crew members indicates that Level will be closely integrated with Iberia, which is part of the International Airlines Group (IAG). This move will allow for cost-saving and operational synergies between the two airlines.

IAG's entry into the long-haul, low-cost market with Level is seen as a strategic response to the growing market share of other low-cost long-haul carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wow Air. Level aims to tap into the increasing demand for affordable long-haul travel, offering direct flights to popular destinations at competitive prices.

By utilizing Iberia crew members for Level flights, IAG can leverage the existing expertise and experience of its staff, ensuring a high level of service and operational efficiency. This integration may also facilitate seamless coordination between Iberia and Level in terms of resources and logistics, enabling the efficient utilization of aircraft and crew.

The choice of destinations, such as Los Angeles, Oakland, Buenos Aires, and Punta Cana, reflects Level's intention to target popular tourist and business destinations. These locations offer a mix of leisure and corporate travel opportunities, catering to a diverse range of customer segments.

In summary, the use of Iberia crew members for Level's operations underscores the close integration between the two airlines within the IAG group. This strategic move aims to capitalize on the growing demand for low-cost, long-haul travel while benefiting from cost-saving synergies and operational efficiencies through utilizing existing resources."
"Three people were sent to the city's Royal Gwent Hospital and seven were treated at Friars Walk on Wednesday.
People said they felt unwell after reportedly smelling gas.
The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was actually caused by a ""completely harmless"" strong glue.
An ambulance was called at 15:35 GMT after a number of people reported feeling unwell at a restaurant in the centre.
Matthew Cann, the service's control manager, said: ""Following an update, it was apparently an epoxy resin which was being used by workmen on site.
""It's not a gas leak, it is a resin, a strong glue, and completely harmless apart from dizziness and headaches in some people.
""The seven patients we are holding at the scene are going to be discharged and I would imagine the three patients sent to the Royal Gwent Hospital will be discharged when we update the hospital.""
A Wales and West Utilities spokesman said: ""Working closely with the fire and rescue service, our engineer found that the smell was not caused by mains gas and left the situation in the hands of the fire and rescue service.
""However, our engineer will remain on site while the fire and rescue service continues its investigations.""","Three people were sent to the city's Royal Gwent Hospital and seven were treated at Friars Walk on Wednesday. People said they felt unwell after reportedly smelling gas. The Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed that a ""hazardous materials incident"" had occurred, prompting the evacuation of surrounding areas.

The authorities immediately launched an investigation to determine the source of the gas leak. Local residents were advised to stay indoors with their windows closed as a precautionary measure.

The incident caused disruption in the city, with nearby roads and buildings being temporarily closed. Firefighters and emergency response teams were also on the scene to assist in the evacuation and ensure the safety of the residents.

The Royal Gwent Hospital provided initial treatment to the three individuals who were affected by the gas, while Friars Walk attended to the seven others. The exact nature of their symptoms or conditions has not been disclosed.

Both hospitals worked closely with the emergency services to manage the incident and provide appropriate care to the affected individuals. The health authorities assured the public that they were taking all necessary measures to address the situation and ensure the safety of the community.

As investigations into the incident continue, residents and local businesses are being urged to remain vigilant and report any gas"
"The search is now on for volunteers to help target the money in rural parts of Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham.
They will form local action groups with the regeneration agency Cadwyn Clwyd administering the scheme.
Cadwyn Clwyd manager Lowri Owain said: ""The main qualification will be that they have their finger on the pulse of their area.""","The search is now on for volunteers to help target the money in rural parts of Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham.

"The East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust cited ""the very high use of temporary staffing, particularly medical locums"" as one of the reasons.
The trust said its financial position had been ""deteriorating rapidly"".
Interim chief executive Chris Bown said even if ""we had all the money in the world"" it would still have problems.
Simon Bolton, regional organiser of the union Unison, said the trust had been placed in an ""impossible position"".
""In common with most acute hospitals in Kent and the rest of the country, East Kent Hospitals is experiencing real financial problems.
""This is a result of the last government's policies when they stripped out £20bn and also the new NHS five-year plan that wants £22bn to come out.
""The internal market in the NHS and the Lansley reforms - if you can call them that - have decimated the NHS,"" he said.
Speaking in February, Andrew Lansley, who was the health secretary behind the changes, said patient care had been improved, and patients would ""continue to see the results"" of the reforms.
The trust runs the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford; the Kent and Canterbury in Canterbury; the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (QEQM) in Margate; the Buckland in Dover; and the Royal Victoria in Folkestone.
Mr Bown said: ""We're probably looking at around £37m deficit at the end of this year if we deliver a £16m savings programme, which is very challenging.
""But you have to put that into context. Remember the turnover, the budget, for this trust is over half a billion pounds a year - £550m per year of taxpayers' money - so whilst it's of significant number, we have to see it in that context.""
The trust also has a high number of unfilled vacancies across its sites - 200 nurses are needed, and more than 80 doctors, Mr Bown said.
""It's the high cost of agency and locum doctors and nurses that we're having to use to maintain safe services.""
He added that the trust was looking at a two or three-year ""programme of change and recovery"".
""It's not something that's going to change overnight,"" he said.","The East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust cited ""the very high use of temporary staffing, particularly medical locums"" as one of the reasons. The trust said its financial position had ""deteriorated significantly"" and that it was forecasting a year-end deficit of £57.2 million ($74.9 million). The use of temporary staffing, particularly medical locums, was identified as a contributing factor to the financial difficulties.

The trust explained that the reliance on temporary staff was due to difficulties in recruiting and retaining permanent staff, especially in highly specialized medical fields. The costs associated with hiring temporary staff were significantly higher than employing permanent staff members, putting a strain on the trust's budget.

In addition to the financial implications, the trust acknowledged that the heavy reliance on temporary staffing had implications for patient care and safety. Continuity of care and familiarity with patients' medical histories could be compromised when relying on locum doctors who may not be familiar with the hospital's protocols and practices.

To address these challenges, the trust outlined plans to improve recruitment and retention strategies, enhance staff training and development, and invest in workforce planning. The goal is to reduce the reliance on temporary staff and establish a stable and sustainable workforce.

The financial difficulties faced by the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust serve as a reminder of the wider issue of workforce shortages within the healthcare system, particularly in specialized fields. It highlights the need for comprehensive strategies to address recruitment and retention challenges, ensuring a stable and skilled workforce to provide high-quality patient care."
"The two men became involved in a personal row during Wednesday's event, accusing each other of misleading the public over EU powers.
Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said he was on a mission to reverse ""myth-making"".
Mr Farage said his rival had ""gone for me"" rather than dealing with issues.
During the bad-tempered hour-long debate, Mr Farage accused Europhile Mr Clegg of ""wilfully lying"" over Brussels' powers over the UK, while Mr Clegg claimed the UKIP leader was peddling ""dangerous fantasies"".
Opinion polls suggest Mr Farage, who wants the UK to leave the EU, was more successful in persuading viewers of his case.
Asked on BBC Breakfast whether ""his man"", Mr Clegg, had won, Mr Cameron replied: ""I didn't have a dog in the fight, as it were.""
The prime minister summarised the debate by saying: ""Nick thinks there's nothing wrong with Europe and we shouldn't have a referendum, and Nigel thinks there's nothing right with Europe and we should just get out and leave. They're both wrong.""
Mr Cameron has said he will renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before holding an in/out referendum in 2017, if the Conservatives win the next general election.
""That's what Britain needs and it's what people want: a proper choice but real change in Europe and that's what these European elections should be about,"" he said.
He said Mr Farage did not ""recognise the fact that we've got to trade and compete in Europe"".
""The problem with the UKIP view is it's sort of: 'Stop the world, I want to get off, Britain can't succeed.' It's deeply pessimistic. I'm very optimistic,"" Mr Cameron added.
By Ben WrightPolitical correspondent, Brussels
The BBC debate was the second Farage-Clegg confrontation to be held in as many weeks.
YouGov's snap poll gave it to Mr Farage by 68% to 27%, while a poll by ICM/Guardian found 69% of people watching thought the UKIP man had come out on top.
On BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, Mr Clegg said he did not feel damaged by this verdict, adding: ""I'm delighted we had the debate. I would do it every day of the week if people were up for it.""
He added that he intended to overcome ""20 years of myth-making"" about the EU, insisting: ""It's a marathon, not a sprint. This debate is going to continue.""
The deputy prime minister said it was ""extraordinary"" that Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband had declined to take part.
During the debate, Mr Farage distanced himself from Mr Clegg and other ""career politicians"", who he said were too willing to accept orders from Brussels.
But, on Jeremy Vine, Mr Clegg said that, like himself, Mr Farage had attended an ""expensive"" London school and had been a member of the European Parliament since 1999, making him a career politician.
He said: ""He must explain why that kind of background makes him some kind of Sid Vicious character.""
Appearing on the same programme, Mr Farage responded: ""I spent 20 years in business. I've lived and breathed and worked in the real world and there's almost nobody left in frontline politics with that experience of the commercial world.""
He also criticised his opponent's debating style, saying: ""Nick Clegg made the mistake that career politicians have been making over the last few years. He decided, rather than dealing with the issues, to go for me and to go for UKIP's ideology, to paint us out as somehow to be mad, ranting conspiracy theorists, when all we want to do is govern our own country.
""That line of argument by Clegg turned people against him.""
Mr Clegg kicked off Wednesday's debate - hosted by David Dimbleby - by accusing his opponent of foisting a ""dangerous con"" on the public by arguing for Britain's exit from the EU, telling the audience in the BBC's radio theatre that ""if it sounds too good to be true, it is"".
Mr Farage said he did not want Britain to be part of an ""expansionist"" EU foreign policy, claiming that the EU wants its own ""army and navy"".
The pair traded verbal blows over the percentage of British laws made in Brussels and argued over the effects of immigration.
Towards the end of the debate, the UKIP leader issued a warning about the rise of far-right parties in Europe, saying: ""I want the EU to end but I want it to end democratically. If it doesn't end democratically I'm afraid it will end very unpleasantly.""
He used his closing statement to make a pitch for votes in May's European elections, saying:  ""I would urge people - come and join the people's army. Let's topple the establishment who got us into this mess.""
Mr Clegg, in his closing remarks, promised ""real remedies for the way the world is today, not dangerous fantasies about a bygone world that no longer exists
""And that is why I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we remain part of the European Union because that is how we protect the Britain we love.""
Speaking on BBC One's Question Time, Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""Farage, to give him credit, is a very effective, if demagogic, debater.""
He also said Mr Clegg deserved ""a lot of credit for showing the bottle to go out and debate"".
The SNP said it believed in ""positive engagement"" with the EU and an independent Scotland would have ""a seat at the top table in Europe"".
Plaid Cymru said it wanted a ""strong voice"" for Wales in Brussels and it was concerned that Wales could be ""pulled out of the EU against its own will and its own interests"".","The two men became involved in a personal row during Wednesday's event, accusing each other of misleading the public over EU powers. Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said he was disappointed by the lack of clarity from the other party, while UKIP leader Mr Farage accused Mr Clegg of fearmongering. The heated exchange highlighted the deep divide between the two parties on the issue of Europe, with the Lib Dems advocating for closer integration with the EU and UKIP campaigning for complete withdrawal. Despite the tense atmosphere, both leaders reiterated their commitment to holding a fair and respectful debate on the matter."
"England's Massaro, 32, trailed in the decisive fifth game but rallied to seal an 11-8, 12-14, 11-9, 8-11, 11-9 win.
The world number three also won the US Open on 18 October.
""It's amazing to win another major trophy - I'm over the moon,"" said Massaro. ""Physically and mentally I feel in a really good place.""
Egyptian world number one Mohamed Elshorbagy, 24, took the men's title, beating Frenchman Gregory Gaultier 11-5, 11-7, 5-11, 12-10 at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex in Doha.
But it was Massaro's match - 73 minutes in length - which proved the most intriguing encounter as she came from a game down to eventually overcome El Sherbini, who is ranked five places lower.
""There's a lot of great names on that trophy so it's a great feeling to know that my name will go alongside them now,"" added Massaro, who closes the gap to Egypt's world number one Raneem El Welily and number two Nicol David, of Malaysia, with the win.

Massaro's victory adds to her already impressive list of achievements, including being the reigning world champion and winning the British Open multiple times.

The match was a grueling battle between Massaro and her opponent, with both players showcasing their skills and determination. Massaro started strong, taking an early lead in the match. However, her opponent didn't back down and fought back to win the second game.

The third and fourth games were closely contested, with both players going shot for shot. Massaro managed to hold her nerve and win both games by a slim margin. However, in the fifth and final game, her opponent took the lead and seemed to be on the verge of victory.

But Massaro never gave up. She dug deep and mounted a comeback, winning crucial points when it mattered the most. With a display of incredible resilience, she managed to turn the tide in her favor and secure the win.

Massaro's victory at the US Open is a testament to her exceptional skill, determination, and never-say-d"
"Sabah al-Numan told the BBC that many IS fighters had been killed.
Government forces entered the city's outskirts for the first time on Tuesday since the city was seized in June 2014.
Wednesday is the 17th day of the anti-IS operation, which involves 50,000 personnel including Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Sunni Arab tribesmen.
Elite troops seized control of the state TV building in Kukjali on Tuesday hours after launching an assault on the eastern district and later breached the outskirts of the Karama district.
A BBC journalist travelling with them said they were facing stiff resistance.
But Mr al-Numan, a spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) said: ""We broke the front line of the centre of Mosul. We liberated a very important area which is the main gate for Mosul from the east.
""We had a very tough fight with ISIS in this area and we could liberate it very fast and also without any casualties, in front of many dead and executed from ISIS.""
Mosul is last major urban stronghold of IS in the country.
The men of the special forces appear casual - but make no mistake, they are ready.
Many have scars from Ramadi or Falluja or both. They have lost friends. Some are younger than you might expect for the fighting they have experienced.
Many are also recently married - common practice before deploying for battle - and keen to show pictures of their new brides on their smart phones.
From low-ranked soldiers to top generals, all say this is not going to be easy. The mission could take months.
But liberating Mosul is the fight they have been waiting for.
The ugly, deadly urban warfare of Mosul
Army units are also pushing into the south-eastern Judaydat al-Mufti area, according to the military.
The operation is backed by air and ground support from a US-led coalition.
On Monday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told the 3,000 to 5,000 militants believed to still be inside Mosul that there was ""no escape"" and to ""either surrender or die"".
About 1,000 of the militants are thought to be foreigners. Gen Talib Shaghati al-Kenani said they came from Uzbekistan, Turkey and other countries.
""Those are a group of terrorists who fight Iraqis and usurp their cities,"" Gen Kenani said.
Many people have fled the area but some civilians have returned to their homes in villages around Mosul, some waving white flags to show they are not fighters.
As Mosul is encircled, UN officials have expressed concern for the safety of the 1.5 million civilians estimated to be living there.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Tuesday that it had received fresh reports of mass killings and forced relocations carried out by IS.
The UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said 1,792 people were killed in October, 1,120 of whom were civilians.","Sabah al-Numan told the BBC that many IS fighters had been killed. Government forces entered the city's outskirts for the first time on Tuesday since the city was seized in 2014 by the Islamic State (IS). Government forces have been coordinating with Kurdish and tribal fighters in an offensive to regain control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The operation, which began earlier this month, has made significant progress with the recapture of several surrounding villages. The liberation of Mosul would mark a major blow to IS, as the city has served as their stronghold in Iraq for the past two years."
"It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload.
Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence.
The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST).
Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator.
Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.
Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now.
It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage.
Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas.
The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors.
Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton.
The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine.
The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine.
Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again.
The Proton has had a torrid record of late.
Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced.
""The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,"" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News.
The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.
Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.
Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.
The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.
""If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,"" said Mr Franci
""So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.""

However, the delay in the review has caused some concern and uncertainty about the timeline for Inmarsat's next launch. The company is eagerly awaiting the review results and expects to receive an update soon."
"Integration with the mainland has brought Hong Kong much success as a global financial centre but it has also created problems.
Those problems seem to be at their worst at any time since the handover, according to a series of surveys and opinion polls.
The gap between Hong Kong's rich and poor is at a 30-year high, property rental prices have risen to record levels and residents are upset by daily news reports on corrupt lives of officials at the highest levels of Chinese government.
An independent poll shows the Hong Kong public's mistrust of the Chinese government stands at a post handover high, largely because of a number of political scandals.
These include the sacking of senior Communist Party official Bo Xilai, the plight of human rights activist Chen Guangcheng and, most seriously, the suspicious death of Tiananmen Square dissident Li Wangyang in June.
""What happens in China very closely affects Hong Kong people, because we're all ethnic Chinese,"" said Frank Lee, a pollster at the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme.
""That's probably the reason why, at this moment, many people don't trust the Beijing government. In fact, anger is at the peak right now.""
Despite a relatively strong economy and a string of financial incentives announced by Beijing to boost popular support in the semi-autonomous city, Hong Kong is a much more restive place than it was five years ago, when Mr Hu last came to visit, in a blaze of pre-Olympic glory.
Ahead of the visit, Hong Kong's census bureau publicised data that showed inequality had widened to its highest level in three decades.
According to US government rankings, Hong Kong's wealth gap now outstrips all other developed nations. It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.
Monthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.
Sze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.
""The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development. So they have done little for the poor,"" she said during a visit to a cramped sub-divided flat.
The first-floor flat is in the shadow of the glitzy commercial district of Causeway Bay.
Inside two dozen people - mostly single middle-age or elderly men - reside in enclosed wooden bunks the size of a single bed.
Locals call these coffin homes, because each is slightly larger than the size of a coffin. Rent ranges from HK$1,000 ($128, £83) to HK$1,400 per bunk.
Lee Chi Wai, a 57-year-old cleaner with a warm smile, lives with his worldly possessions - a tiny television, a few compact disks, some plastic shelves and several shirts - directly below Wong Ching Po, 60.
When not working, the two men watch television and engage in friendly banter. Both decry the lack of opportunities and inadequate public housing in Hong Kong.
""It's very hard to find a job,"" said Mr Lee. ""Most companies have moved to China. Those that stay want temporary workers not permanent staff. When the contract is over, I have to look for another job. That is why life is hard.""
Following the release of the census figures, Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive CY Leung - who is to be sworn in on Sunday - announced he would chair a new preparatory task force to tackle poverty.
Besides anger over social inequality, Mr Hu will be greeted by two large-scale democracy protests over the weekend.
The rally on Sunday is the annual human rights demonstration that traditionally starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Hong Kong government office in Admiralty.
""Hong Kong people are very uptight about freedom issues on the mainland, because they reflect on us. If not today, then tomorrow. If it's not in Hong Kong's present, it's going to reflect on our future,"" said Claudia Mo, a member of the Civic Party.
Last year more than 200,000 people took part. This year organisers hope the crowd will be even larger because Hong Kong residents feel the Chinese government is becoming more, not less, corrupt and repressive.
The other rally on Saturday, due to finish at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre in Wanchai, is timed to coincide with Mr Hu's dinner plans.
Protesters will demand a reversal of the official verdict on Tiananmen Square, currently branded a counter-revolutionary activity, and a thorough investigation into the death of Mr Li, the elderly, disabled Chinese activist.
Mr Li's suspicious death in early June in central China sparked outrage in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have promised a proper investigation, but Hong Kong people remain sceptical.
Although Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time.
Five years ago, China seemed relatively open to democratic reform, as it promised organisers who awarded Beijing the 2008 games.
Restrictions were eased for foreign and Hong Kong journalists. Activists such as AIDS campaigner Hu Jia and pro-democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo were given relative free rein to air their views.
The country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.
But this year the political atmosphere is strained as Mr Hu arrives bearing financial incentives to drum up public support. He is expected to stay until Sunday.","Integration with the mainland has brought Hong Kong much success as a global financial centre but it has also created problems. Those problems seem to be at their worst at present, with the ongoing political unrest and protests in Hong Kong.

One of the main problems created by integration with the mainland is the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and the perceived threat to its civil liberties. The ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which was meant to guarantee Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy until 2047, has been increasingly challenged. Critics argue that mainland China is tightening its grip on Hong Kong's political and legal systems, thereby curbing the city's freedoms of speech, assembly, and press.

The extradition bill, which sparked the current unrest, is seen as a prime example of this erosion of autonomy. The bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where the rule of law and human rights protections are perceived to be weaker. Many in Hong Kong saw this as a threat to their personal safety and fundamental rights, leading to mass protests that have lasted for months.

Integration with the mainland has also led to increased economic inequality in Hong Kong. While the city's financial sector has flourished, benefiting from its status as a gateway between China and the rest of the world, the wealth generated has not been evenly distributed. The cost of living has soared, making it increasingly challenging for ordinary residents to afford housing, healthcare, and other basic needs. This has contributed to a growing sense of frustration and discontentment among the population.

Furthermore, the integration has also resulted in a strained social and cultural fabric. The influx of mainland Chinese tourists and immigrants has led to clashes between locals and mainlanders. Many Hong Kong residents feel a loss of identity and cultural heritage, as they perceive their unique way of life being overshadowed by mainland influence.

Overall, while integration with the mainland has brought economic success to Hong Kong, it has come at the cost of eroded autonomy, increased inequality, and social tensions. These problems have reached a boiling point in recent times, leading to widespread protests and calls for greater democracy and safeguards for Hong Kong's way of life."
"Their talent agency has said only that they are in negotiations over their future, but as the BBC's Mariko Oi explains, a split would be a huge shock for Japan.
SMAP - which stands for sport, music, assemble, people - formed in 1988 when its six original members were in their teens.
Now in their 40s - and minus one member - they have appeared in movies and soap operas, have dozens of advertising deals and have become ambassadors for Japan abroad.
Masahiro Nakai, Goro Inagaki, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Shingo Katori and Takuya Kimura have been a constant presence in the media landscape with Japanese fans calling them their idols.
They were the first boy band to not only have multiple hit songs but also parlay that success into comedy and acting with their weekly variety show SMAPxSMAP and numerous other appearances.
The group's leader, Masahiro Nakai, has been the main newscaster in Japan for several Olympic games. Arguably the most popular and internationally recognised member Takuya Kimura has been voted the sexiest man in Japan for 15 years in a row by one magazine.
Their popularity has even made them ambassadors for diplomatic relations between Japan, China and South Korea. In 2011, they were the first Japanese pop group to visit China in a decade, amid a row between the countries over disputed territory. Their Beijing concert was attended by 40,000 people.
Like many pop groups, there has been speculation before that SMAP could be about to split. One of its members, Katsuyuki Mori, left in 1996 - at the height of their popularity - to become a successful motorbike racer.
But the new rumours indicate there is politics at play at the talent agency that manages them.
Johnny&Associates dominates the pop and entertainment industry. But reports say SMAP's manager, Michi Iijima, who masterminded their rise since the late 1980s, has fallen out with its founders and is leaving.
All but one of SMAP's members are reported to be considering following her out of the company, which would almost certainly be the end of the group as we know it.
The agency has acknowledged the reports but only said: ""It is a fact that negotiation and discussions are being held regarding the matter.""
On the other hand, they could be negotiating for more money in order to stay with the firm.
Although Korean pop (Kpop) has now largely overtaken Jpop in terms of popularity in Asia and beyond, SMAP and others like it are seen as among the first to spark a boy band craze in Asia.
They had developed a huge fan base over their nearly three decades in the industry.
For people in their 30s and younger in Japan, who have grown up with this band, news of a split would be shocking.
But they also have older fans - women who would travel across Japan to all their concerts and give them expensive gifts, seeing them as the ideal sons.
Like other pop acts around the world, some have questioned SMAP's singing and acting skills.
But love them or hate them, many continued to follow their careers even once they had passed their peak in terms of boy band success.","Their talent agency has said only that they are in negotiations over their future, but as the BBC's Mariko Oi explains, a split would be a huge shock for Japan. A split would be a huge shock for Japan as this talent agency is extremely popular and influential in the country. The agency represents some of Japan's biggest celebrities, including actors, singers, and TV personalities. Their talent agency has been responsible for launching the careers of numerous famous individuals and has a significant presence in the entertainment industry. Thus, if they were to separate, it would likely have a significant impact on the Japanese entertainment landscape."

"The proposals for North Wales Hospital in Denbigh have been put forward by Prince's Regeneration Trust.
Denbighshire council won a compulsory purchase order earlier this year from the site's owners amid concerns about the Grade II-listed building.
Freemont (Denbigh) Ltd is expected to retain ownership until early 2017.
Subject to the change of ownership, Denbighshire council plans to hand over the former Victorian asylum to North Wales Buildings Preservation Trust.
It will operate as a not-for-profit organisation raising the money to preserve the listed buildings on the site via its ""enabling development"" plans, with profits made from the sale of new properties elsewhere on the site.
Freemont bought the hospital site in 2003 following its closure in 1996.
Planning permission was granted in 2006 for a redevelopment scheme but it has since expired and no work was carried out.
In 2015, the council spent Â£900,000 on emergency repairs in a bid to protect it from deterioration.
Freemont, which is based in the British Virgin Isles, had opposed the compulsory purchase, while Ayub Bhailok, speaking on the company's behalf, called the latest plans ""flawed and unsustainable"".
On Wednesday, Denbighshire council's planning committee approved the latest proposals.
Ward councillor Colin Hughes said the development would ""be very good for the town"", bringing an increase in residents and visitors.
""The importance of this development to the future of Denbigh is immeasurable,"" he said.
""Nothing has happened here apart from deterioration in the last 21 years,"" he added, referring to the building itself which, he said, had played a large part of people's lives in the past.
""As it is now it is absolutely useless to us.""","The proposals for North Wales Hospital in Denbigh have been put forward by Prince's Regeneration Trust. Denbighshire council won a compulsory purchase order earlier this year from the site's owners in order to secure the future of the historic building. The proposals aim to transform the North Wales Hospital into a vibrant cultural and heritage hub, offering a range of activities and facilities to the local community and visitors.

The Prince's Regeneration Trust, a charity founded by Prince Charles, has extensive experience in restoring and repurposing historic buildings. They have worked on numerous projects across the UK, breathing new life into neglected structures.

Denbighshire council's successful compulsory purchase order means that the site's owners were legally obligated to sell the property to the council. This decision was made with the intention of safeguarding the future of the North Wales Hospital, which had fallen into disrepair over the years.

The proposed plans for the hospital include creating spaces for cultural events, exhibitions, and workshops, as well as providing facilities for local artists and businesses to thrive. The aim is to rejuvenate the site and make it a center for creativity and community engagement.

The Prince's Regeneration Trust will work closely with the council and other stakeholders to ensure that the redevelopment of the North Wales Hospital respects the building's history and architectural significance. They will also collaborate with local organizations to involve the community in the planning and implementation processes.

The proposals have been met with enthusiasm by local residents and heritage enthusiasts who are excited about the potential benefits the revitalized North Wales Hospital could bring to the area. The project promises to create new opportunities for economic growth, tourism, and cultural exchange.

Overall, the proposals put forward by the Prince's Regeneration Trust and supported by Denbighshire council hope to breathe new life into the North Wales Hospital and transform it"
"Some 60 excavators and 100 dump trucks are being used in the search. The boy fell down the 40m dry well in Baoding, Hebei province on Sunday morning.
He had been helping harvest vegetables, his father told Chinese media. The child's condition is unknown.
Oxygen, food and water have been supplied. The 30cm-diameter well is too narrow for an adult to retrieve him.
After two days of careful digging, rescuers have dug only 13m down the metal shaft, which threatens to collapse at any moment.
An 800-square metre work area has been cleared to facilitate rescue attempts, a volunteer told The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.
The well had been left unused for five years and there were no warning signs. Visual imagery has so far failed to locate the boy.
Many locals volunteered to help in the rescue, rushing to the scene after learning about the accident on WeChat, a popular communication app in China.
Most netizens sent good wishes to the boy.
""It was saddening to read about such news. As a mother, it was heartbreaking to see a child fall into a well. I hope the child will be alive and alive,"" one user called 80 Hou Bu Huai wrote.
Some wondered who was to blame.
Weibo user S_AND_YY wrote: ""Parents have to take care of their children and it's dangerous everywhere.""
But not everyone agreed.
""The kid is in primary one already. Do his parents have to spend every minute with him? Is it possible? Shouldn't the well be the focus? If the well didn't exist, would this accident happen?"" wrote another user.

Rescue teams arrived at the scene with 60 excavators and 100 dump trucks to aid in the search and rescue operation. The well was approximately 40 meters deep, making the task particularly challenging. 

Using the excavators and dump trucks, the rescue teams began to dig around the well, carefully removing the dirt and debris. They created a safe pathway for the workers to descend into the well and reach the stranded boy. 

After hours of intense efforts, the rescue teams managed to reach the boy. They carefully lifted him out of the well and immediately provided medical attention. Despite the ordeal, the boy was found to be in stable condition and was quickly transferred to a nearby hospital for further evaluation. 

The successful rescue operation highlights the importance of quick response and effective coordination among emergency services. The use of heavy machinery such as excavators and dump trucks played a crucial role in ensuring a safe and efficient rescue."

"Scientists first described the Hero Shrew, nicknamed for its extraordinary strength, over a century ago.
Now for the first time, a team has found a new, smaller-skulled species of the Hero Shrew which they have called Scutisorex thori.
The authors propose in Royal Society journal: Biology Letters that its unique interlocking vertebrae give it the strength to move large objects.
The new species has fewer lower vertebrae and more robust and flattened ribs than its relative.
Bill Stanley, from the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, US, said: ""The expanded backbone and the strength of this animal has fascinated biologists for over 100 years. Until now there has been only one species known with this bizarre vertebral column.
""We hypothesise that this shrew - with its expanded backbone and associated musculature - can crawl in-between the trunk and leaf bases of trees to allow access to concentrated food resources that would normally be protected from predation.
""The same mechanism could be used for getting under logs or rocks which they could lift out of the way.""
The unique Hero Shrew has twice the number of lower vertebrae humans do and a spine four times more robust relative to its body size.
Its strength has received legendary status in the African Congo, where parts of the animal are worn as a talisman in battle. The wearers believe it could make them invincible to spears or bullets.
As no other forms of its expanded back bone have previously been discovered, many zoologists believed the Hero Shrew was an example of punctuated equilibrium - which is where dramatic evolutionary changes take place very quickly.
But Mr Stanley explained that there are aspects of S. thori's vertebral column that ""suggest it's a transition between the regular shrew and the original species of Hero Shrew"", which could shed light on how quickly it evolved.
He told BBC News it had the potential to be a ""missing link"" to how the Hero relates to other shrews.
""The age of discovery is not over. People think we have everything sussed out but the collections contained within institutions [such as the Field Museum] allow us to figure out what makes this planet tick.
""This is just one example of a new mammal but there's still a lot more to this planet we have to learn about.""
Kristofer Helgen, of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the study, said it was an ""outstanding find"".
""The anatomy of this new species gives important clues about the evolution of the unusually strong spine in this group of shrews, and the authors of the paper provide the first compelling explanation for the adaptive significance of the unusual spine.""","Scientists first described the Hero Shrew, nicknamed for its extraordinary strength, over a century ago. Now for the first time, a team has found a new, smaller-skulled species of the Hero Shrew. This discovery has led to new insights into the shrew's unique anatomy and its remarkable ability to withstand extreme forces.

The Hero Shrew, scientifically known as Scutisorex somereni, is native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has captured the attention of researchers for its incredible physical abilities. It is famous for its ability to bend its spine with exceptional resistance to allow it to squeeze through tight spaces or withstand crushing forces.

Recently, a team of researchers discovered a new species of Hero Shrew with a smaller skull, named Scutisorex thori. This finding was unexpected, as scientists previously believed that all Hero Shrews had the same skull structure. The team, led by Dr. Jacob Esselstyn from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, published their findings in the journal Current Biology.

Through detailed anatomical examinations and genetic analysis, the team determined that Scutisorex thori has a distinct cranial morphology when compared to its larger-skulled counterpart. The smaller skull has different proportions and features that point to unique adaptations. It is speculated that this variation may be related to different ecological factors or evolutionary pressures specific to the regions inhabited by each species.

The ability of the Hero Shrew to resist forces is known to be linked to its unique spinal structure. Unlike other shrews and mammals, its vertebrae are thick and tightly interlocked, giving its backbone tremendous strength. The discovery of the smaller-skulled species provides an opportunity to investigate how this adaptation is achieved with different skull sizes.

This finding adds to our understanding of the Hero Shrew's evolutionary history and its incredible physical adaptation. The research team hopes that further study of the smaller-skulled species will shed light on the different ecological roles and evolutionary pressures influencing the Hero Shrew populations.

Exploring the unique anatomy and abilities of the Hero Shrew not only provides valuable insights into the natural world but also contributes to our knowledge of biomechanics and physical resilience in mammals. The Hero Shrew's remarkable strength continues to captivate scientists and serves as a reminder of the wonders and diversity that exist in the animal kingdom."
"They've gained new insights into how cells transport chemicals, the hormone insulin and the brain chemical serotonin, in a project that combined biophysics and mathematics.
It could one day have implications for the treatment of diseases like diabetes and neurological conditions.
Specialised cells in locations like our brain or pancreas create the helpful chemicals and transport them to the surface in tiny bubble-like structures called vesicles.
Deep inside a cell, these vesicles travel along similar chemical tracks towards the surface.
When they arrive at the cell surface, they still move towards certain points but the tracks cannot be seen.
The team established why: the tracks are not there. Instead, the vesicles are avoiding other molecules.
It's a breakthrough, but it's not been instantaneous. It has taken seven years of intensive research.
It is that long since Heriot-Watt biophysicist Prof Rory Duncan explained the problem of the missing tracks in a lecture.
Happily, there was a mathematician in the house.
""This guy from maths, who thinks very, very differently to the rest of us, said it looks these things are following valleys between mountains,"" Prof Duncan said.
The ""guy from maths"" was Prof Gabriel Lord. He showed me an animation based on his mathematical model of what happens when the vesicles leave their tracks and move across the surface of the cell
""What we've shown happens is that these vesicles move between the valleys of these other molecules - and they'll do so with some randomness"", he says.
What took so long? Gathering a massive amount of data on vesicle behaviour.
That involved using the microscopes of the Edinburgh Super-Resolution Imaging Consortium (ESRIC) based at Heriot-Watt.
It was able to gather nano-scale information of the movements within cells.
To give you an idea of that scale, the vesicles were about as small to us as Jupiter is huge.
Dr Ali Dun manages ESRIC and did her PhD work on the vesicle project.
She said: ""I'd get the cells ready, get the DNA together to be able to put into those cells, get the cells onto the microscopes.
""And we have some really amazing microscopes.
""We'd image those cells and get some movies and recordings, take those off, put them onto some very sophisticated software and do the analysis.""
Some of the images are things of beauty in their own right.
One, showing hundreds of thousands of vesicle tracks across the surface of a cell, has more than a touch of Jackson Pollock about it.
Wrangling with the huge amounts of data and building a computer model of how the cells get their precious payloads to where they are needed was where the mathematics came in.
Maths may be the language which underpins all of science but there was still a difference in dialects between the two cultures.
""It was one of the biggest challenges of my PhD,"" Dr Dun said.
""I've learnt a whole new language working with a mathematician - and I think Gabriel probably feels the same way.""
Now the team has published its research in the journal Current Biology, what next?
Prof Duncan warns that it typically takes years to bring new medicines to patients but he says there are implications for new treatments..
""If you have diabetes or certain neurological conditions, for example, something has probably gone wrong with the movement of the cargo in these vesicles inside your cells - and we really don't know what.
""What our new work gives us is a really strong, correct starting point to try to investigate this in the future.""
For Prof Lord, the mathematical modelling approach may lead far beyond biology.
""It's an approach that's going to be used in finance, in astronomy, all over the place.""
The work is a prime example of how collaboration between scientific disciplines is amplifying what we can discover.
It was funded through the Next Generation Optical Microscopy Initiative led by the Medical Research Council.
The biologists could use their super-powerful microscopes to see inside the cells to the vesicles.  The mathematicians used the data to look closer still.","They've gained new insights into how cells transport chemicals, the hormone insulin and the brain chemical serotonin, in a project that combined biophysics and mathematics.

By using a combination of biophysics and mathematics, researchers have been able to gain new insights into how cells transport important chemicals such as insulin and serotonin. This breakthrough could potentially revolutionize drug delivery methods and significantly improve the treatment of various diseases.

Insulin, for example, is a crucial hormone involved in regulating blood sugar levels. Understanding how cells transport insulin could lead to the development of more efficient and targeted insulin delivery systems for diabetic patients. This could reduce the need for frequent insulin injections and improve the management of diabetes.

Similarly, serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. Dysregulation of serotonin levels is associated with various mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety. By gaining a better understanding of how cells transport serotonin, scientists could develop novel approaches to modulate serotonin levels and potentially develop more effective treatments for these disorders.

The combination of biophysics and mathematics in this research project allows scientists to model and simulate cell transport processes, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms involved. This multidisciplinary approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of cell biology and opens up new possibilities for targeted drug delivery and personalized medicine.

In the future, this research could lead to the development of innovative drug delivery systems that can precisely deliver medications to specific cells and tissues, maximizing their therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects. This could have a profound impact on the treatment of various diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer.

Overall, the integration of biophysics and mathematics offers exciting opportunities for advancements in drug delivery and healthcare.

"Greg Clark said this statement of the government's objectives had helped persuade Nissan to boost its investment in the UK, securing thousands of jobs.
Ministers have been under pressure to clarify the ""support and assurances"" Nissan said it received.
Labour said Nissan had been told more about the Brexit strategy than MPs had.
Opposition parties have called on the government to spell out to Parliament what it wants to achieve from its Brexit talks before they formally begin.
And speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Clark was asked how he had persuaded Nissan to build the new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland base.
The Japanese company's commitment to Britain's biggest car plant had been in doubt following the referendum on EU membership.
Mr Clark said he had assured Nissan that Britain would be ""a great place to do business in the future"".
The business secretary was unexpectedly candid after days of calls for clarity about what guarantees the government had given the car maker.
As Mr Clark detailed the letter he wrote to Nissan's chief executive he provided further insight into the government's approach to its Brexit negotiations - at least insofar as the car making industry was concerned.
He signalled that ministers would seek tariff-free trade with other EU countries, and would provide support to ensure the industry remains ""competitive"" in Britain.
All this sounded a lot more like the ""running commentary"" on Brexit the government had been trying to avoid - a feature that may become more common as ministers come under pressure to ward off business uncertainty ahead of the negotiations.
While formal negotiations with the EU have not yet begun, he said: ""I was able to convey what our demeanour would be, in those negotiations.""
He said it would not be in either side's interests for tariffs to exist in the motor industry, adding: ""So what I said is that our objective would be to ensure that we have continued access to the markets in Europe and vice versa without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.""
Pressed on the contents of the key letter he sent to Nissan, Mr Clark said that as well as seeking a ""common ground"" in Brexit talks, it included commitments to continue to make funds available for skills and training, to ""bring home"" elements of the supply chain which had migrated overseas, to support research and development, and to keep the UK car industry competitive.
He suggested the assurances would apply to the whole of the UK's car sector but added that ""it's not general"".
Since the announcement of Nissan's investment on Thursday, Labour has been calling for details of the promises made to the company and for similar assurances to apply to other industries.
Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""extraordinary"" that Mr Clark had revealed more about the government's Brexit plan than it had disclosed to Parliament.
He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""It's not just this deal that we need to know about - it's what happens to the other businesses.
""Businesses are talking to me all of the time and they are very worried about what happens to them.
""They want to trade on the same terms and if there is a deal that's good enough for Nissan they are saying, and it's quite understandable, 'well, we want broadly the same deal for us'.""
Mr Starmer said the government was refusing to reveal its Brexit plan to MPs, ""but they told Nissan part of the plan and it's in a letter and the sooner we see that letter the better"".","Greg Clark said this statement of the government's objectives had helped persuade Nissan to boost its investment in the UK, securing thousands of jobs. Ministers have been under pressure to provide clarity on their objectives and plans for the UK economy following the Brexit vote."
"He founded the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group in the 1990s and, when that was banned, revived a much older organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in 2002.
Mr Saeed maintains JuD is a Islamic welfare organisation, but the US says it is a front for LeT.
In 2012 Washington announced a $10m (Â£8m) bounty for information leading to his arrest and conviction but, despite periods of detention over the years, he has remained free.
Now, however, he is under house arrest in Lahore, in a move seen as a response to actions by Donald Trump's White House against nations deemed linked to terrorism.
In a rare interview in 2014, Hafiz Saeed told the BBC he had nothing to do with the Mumbai attacks, calling evidence against him ""just propaganda"" by India.
""The people of Pakistan know me and they love me. No-one has tried to approach the American authorities to get this bounty. My role is very clear, and God is protecting me.""
Delhi accuses Mr Saeed and his organisation of carrying out several militant attacks on its territory and has been highly critical of the freedom he enjoys in Pakistan.
But to date, Pakistan has maintained there is no evidence to arrest him and put him on trial.
He was detained for three months after LeT was accused of carrying out the attack on the Indian parliament in 2001. In August 2006, he was detained for activities which the government said were ""detrimental"" to its relations with other governments, but released in December.
Two years later he was again put under house arrest, this time following the Mumbai attacks of November 2008.
The Pakistani government later acknowledged that ""part"" of the conspiracy to attack Mumbai did take place on its soil, and that LeT had been involved.
Several arrests were made in Pakistan in connection with the attacks, but no criminal charges were brought against Mr Saeed. He was freed some six months later.
Significantly, these detentions came at a time of mounting international pressure on Pakistan to rein in the LeT.
Pakistan's actions against the group as a whole have also been tentative, apparently taken under outside pressure.
It banned LeT in January 2002 after the US put it on its list of terrorist organisations. Likewise, the US placed JuD on a national watch list in December 2008 after the UN imposed sanctions on the controversial charity.
This raised eyebrows in Pakistan, where the links between the militant and social welfare wings of some groups are often not clear.
Since 9/11, some organisations banned by the US or Pakistan have continued to operate under different aliases, portraying themselves as welfare rather than militant outfits.
In some cases it appears that the authorities have turned a blind eye and the LeT-turned-JuD would appear to be one such example.
LeT was an offshoot of Jamaat-ud-Dawa wal-Irshad, a preaching, publishing and propaganda network set up by Hafiz Saeed for jihad (holy war) in Afghanistan in 1985.
Abdullah Uzzam, a Palestinian scholar and one of the earliest Arab ideologues of jihad in Afghanistan, was a co-founder.
Mr Saeed formed LeT as the militant wing of Jamaat-ud-Dawa wal-Irshad in the early 1990s, when many militant groups started to move from Afghanistan to Kashmir after the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan.
LeT's rise as a major Pakistani group operating in Kashmir has been widely credited to Mr Saeed's close links to the Pakistani military and intelligence services.
The group also had access to huge funds from Middle Eastern mosques and a countrywide network to raise donations.
After 9/11 LeT came under increasing international pressure, principally because of its involvement in high-profile attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir and cities in India.
India blamed the group for attacks in Mumbai and Delhi in 2003, 2005 and 2008. It was also named in connection with armed raids on Delhi's Red Fort in December 2000 and on the Indian parliament a year later.
Days before LeT was banned in January 2002, Hafiz Saeed revived the group's parent organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa wal-Irshad, and amended its name.
But there was no significant change in the nature of its activities. JuD offices continued to recruit fighters for militant training camps in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.
The presence of those militants enabled them to start early rescue missions in the aftermath of the earthquake that hit the Kashmir region in October 2005.
That allowed the government to portray JuD as an efficient relief organisation working closely with the Pakistan army as well as UN agencies in quake-hit areas.
Since it was banned, LeT has experienced some defections from its ranks by elements not happy with Pakistan's policy of easing tensions with India.
But independent observers believe the bulk of the organisation has remained united under the clandestine leadership of Hafiz Saeed.
In 2015, Pakistan placed JuD on its watch list, but stopped short of a ban. Hafiz Saeed is also associated with another charity by the name of Falah-e-Insaniyat (Welfare of Humankind), which is on a US blacklist.
His ongoing freedom has been a major irritant to both Delhi and Washington.
Earlier this month, speaking to JuD activists in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, he indicated that he had inside knowledge of a recent deadly raid on India's military in disputed Kashmir.
He told his audience that jihad was the only way to liberate Kashmir from India, and that it was the religious duty of people in Kashmir and Pakistan to take part.
It is not yet clear how long Pakistan plans to keep him under house arrest, and to what end.
""My detention orders are unlawful and we will challenge them in the court,"" he told reporters before he was led away by police. ""These orders have come from Washington.""
Additional reporting by M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad","He founded the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group in the 1990s and, when that was banned, revived a much older organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in 2002.

However, the group is widely believed to be a front for terrorist activities and has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and India. Mr. Saeed has also been accused of being the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which 166 people were killed. Despite facing several legal cases and international sanctions, Mr. Saeed continues to operate freely in Pakistan and actively promotes his extremist ideology."
"Steven Poole, who has since died, often fitted flue connections incorrectly and failed to supply and fit carbon monoxide detectors.
At Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court before his death, he admitted regularly breaching legal requirements.
The council said the burners should be checked as they could be dangerous.
The council said Poole, of Johnston, who traded as SM Poole, also falsely claimed he had correctly carried out the installation and that his work met Hetas (Heating Equipment Testing and Approval Scheme) safety requirements.
Cllr Huw George, cabinet member for environmental and regulatory services, said the council was ""very concerned that there could be several hundred incorrectly fitted stoves in the county, which may very likely be unsafe"".
Hetas said any stoves fitted by Mr Poole should be tested to ensure they are safe to use.
It has written to 500 people warning them to get their burners checked, but the council said it was not convinced many people had responded.
""We are concerned that a significant number of people may not have responded to the letters and we urge anyone affected to contact Hetas without delay,"" Mr George added.","Steven Poole, who has since died, often fitted flue connections incorrectly and failed to supply and fit carbon monoxide detectors.

Poole's negligence was not limited to flue connections and carbon monoxide detectors. It was revealed that he had also ignored other aspects of safety regulations, such as improper installation of gas appliances, faulty wiring, and inadequate ventilation.

The court emphasized the seriousness of Poole's actions, stating that he had a duty of care towards his customers and had blatantly disregarded their safety. His negligence had put people's lives in danger, causing immense harm and suffering to innocent individuals.

"With the New York real estate tycoon's latest pronouncement on closing the US borders to all Muslims, that anxiety has become palpable panic.
Virtually all of Mr Trump's fellow candidates have condemned him, and Republican officials, past and present - from former Vice-President Dick Cheney to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan - have joined the fray.
""As a conservative who truly cares about religious liberty, Donald Trump's bad idea and rhetoric send a shiver down my spine,"" tweeted Matt Moore, head of the Republican Party in South Carolina, a key early voting state in the presidential primary process.
Behind this barrage of criticism is fear that Mr Trump's controversial statements, which would be campaign killers for more traditional candidates, are solidifying his support among increasingly restive conservatives at the expense of the party's long-term ability to assemble the voting coalitions necessary to win the presidency.
Despite his now long record of bombastic remarks, Mr Trump's competitors have surged and receded, while he has remained solid. And he's done so with a brand of anti-immigration, anti-Muslim rhetoric that is flying in the face of a plan the Republican Party set out nearly four years ago to take back the White House in 2016.
Shortly after Mitt Romney's loss to Barack Obama in November 2012, Republican strategists reviewed the election returns and the growing US ethnic diversity and surmised that they had to broaden their party's appeal.
""By the year 2050 we'll be a majority-minority country and in both 2008 and 2012 President Obama won a combined 80% of the votes of all minority groups,"" Republican Party head Reince Priebus said, adding that his party ""cannot and will not write off any demographic or community or region of this country"".
With Mr Trump's latest rhetorical flourish, however, Republicans can likely ""write off"" the support of Muslim US citizens. And his ongoing diatribes against immigration from Latin America aren't going to win the hearts of Hispanics, either. Even if he doesn't capture the nomination, he's pulled his party to the anti-immigrant, nativist right and forced his fellow candidates to take positions that could be harmful when the general election comes around next November.
In perhaps the greatest irony, Mr Trump is waging his war with the Republican establishment and the US media with tools that the conservative movement fashioned  and had previously used with gusto.
During his campaign rallies, he often says 70% of journalists are ""really dishonest"" - capitalising on the distrust of the mainstream media that has been sown by Republican politicians for decades.
Meet all of the 2016 hopefuls
Mr Trump also echoes the traditional conservative condemnations of the federal government in Washington, DC, as a bloated, wasteful institution populated by career politicians who are, intentionally or not, bringing harm to the nation. But he takes those lines and uses them as a blunderbuss against everyone in power, Republicans included.
It's a phenomenon seen on a smaller scale in 2010 and 2012, when numerous establishment-sanctioned Republican Senate candidates were defeated in the primary process by grass-roots-backed candidates who were then skewered by their Democratic counterparts in the general election. That dynamic is now playing out on the presidential stage,
Politicians of all stripes, conservatives and liberals, are corrupted by power, Mr Trump said at a rally in Northern Virginia last Thursday.
""They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful.' And they let us down.""
He went on to demean and dismiss one after another of his Republican opponents. Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, even also-ran George Pataki and former candidate Rick Perry got swiped.
According to conservative commentator Brian Cates, Mr Trump's remarks reveal that he doesn't want to take over the Republican Party, he wants to burn it to the ground from the inside - and his supporters are just fine with that.
""The people endlessly pushing for Trump, they're not doing it because they want a stronger, more conservative GOP,"" Cates tweets. ""They want to destroy the GOP.""
Trump supporters are done with traditional politicians, who they feel have turned their back on their campaign promises to bring a conservative revolution to Washington. ""They are venting their anger at a political party that consistently let them down and betrayed them,"" he writes.
Ask Trump supporters why they stand by their man, however, and you'll get a slightly different story. They're angered by the Republican establishment, but they see Mr Trump not as a protest vehicle, but as a leader who can take charge and do what he says.
""He just has a way of inspiring people,"" says Kristie DelAguila, who attended the Trump rally in Virginia. ""I loved how honest he is. He's not afraid to tell us what we need to hear.""
More than that, however, they contrast Mr Trump's strength with what they perceive as the weakness in the rest of the Republican field.
""I think we have to have a strong leader who makes a stand,"" says Barbara Bradford, a Virginia schoolteacher. ""He doesn't get pushed around. He's got the strength, the leadership, the courage, the mind, the resources. He's got the guts.""
Just last week, it seemed the Republican establishment was trying to make peace with the possibility that Mr Trump could win the nomination. The Washington Post obtained a confidential memo in which a senior party official details how Republicans candidates for Congress could campaign with the brash New Yorker at the top of their party ticket.
""Trump has risen because voters see him as authentic, independent, direct, firm - and believe he can't be bought,"" the memo explains. ""These are the same character traits our candidates should be advancing in 2016.""
Mr Trump was reportedly scheduled to headline a New York fundraiser for the Republican Party, as well - to break bread and bring in dollars for the party he seeks to lead. Those plans have since been scuttled, as Republicans scramble to distance themselves from Mr Trump's latest conflagration.
With Mr Trump playing with matches inside the Republican tent, however, there may be no safe place left for the party to go.","With the New York real estate tycoon's latest pronouncement on closing the US borders to all Muslims, that anxiety has become palpable panic. Virtually all of Mr Trump's fellow candidates have condemned his statement, calling it divisive and un-American. Many Republican leaders have distanced themselves from him, expressing concerns about the negative impact his rhetoric could have on the party's chances in the general election. Some have even gone so far as to say they will not support him if he becomes the nominee.

On the other hand, Trump's supporters have largely stood by him, with some even applauding his proposal. They view his strict stance on immigration as a necessary measure to protect the country from potential threats. They argue that his controversial statements are a reflection of his willingness to address important issues that others are afraid to tackle.

The public reaction to Trump's comments has been mixed. While some people share his concerns about national security and have voiced support for his proposal, others have criticized him for promoting discrimination and xenophobia. Many Muslim-Americans, in particular, have expressed fear and outrage, feeling scapegoated and targeted by his rhetoric.

The international community has also responded to Trump's comments, with leaders from various countries expressing concern and disappointment. The British Prime Minister called his remarks ""divisive, unhelpful, and wrong,"" while the French Prime Minister described them as ""stupidity.""

Overall, Trump's proposal to close the US borders to all Muslims has sparked widespread debate and controversy, highlighting deep divisions within American society and raising questions about the future of the Republican Party."

"Sickness absence totalled 137 million working days last year, the equivalent of 4.3 days per worker, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
When records began in 1993, the equivalent of 7.2 days were lost.
Minor illnesses such as coughs and colds accounted for a quarter of days lost last year, the ONS said.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""It is a myth that UK workers are always throwing sickies.
""We are really a nation of mucus troopers, with people more likely to go to work when ill than stay at home when well.
""Sickness absence rates have fallen steadily over the past decade, and let us not forget that working people put in billions of pounds worth of unpaid overtime each year.""
Back and neck pain were high on the list of causes of sickness absence, as were mental health issues including stress, depression and anxiety.
Sickness absence rates were highest in Wales and Scotland, at 2.6% and 2.5% respectively, and lowest in London, at 1.4%.
Other findings for last year included:
ONS statistician Brendan Freeman said: ""Since 2003, there has been a fairly steady decline in the number of working days lost to sickness, especially during the economic downturn.
""In recent years, there has been a small rise in the number of days lost, but due to an increasing number of people entering the workforce, the rate per worker and overall sickness absence rate have stayed largely flat.""
Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the Manchester Business School at Manchester University, said that people were frightened of taking time off for sickness, and that presenteeism was a big threat to UK workplace productivity.","Sickness absence totalled 137 million working days last year, the equivalent of 4.3 days per worker, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Four men were arrested on suspicion of child neglect while a fifth was held on suspicion of assault. All were bailed.
East Sussex County Council said a young person placed at the STC since the documentary aired made the allegations.
The revelation was made in a report to be considered on Friday by the council's corporate parenting panel - which monitors and ensures the wellbeing of children who are looked after by the authority.
The report said there was just one young person from East Sussex placed in the G4S-run Medway STC during the period in which the filming for the programme took place.
""This young person was not involved in any of the incidents and has been asked explicitly but has not reported any concerns.

The unit takes 12-to-17-year-old youths, both on remand and after conviction.","The BBC's Panorama broadcast evidence of abuse at the Medway Secure Training Centre (STC) in Rochester in January. Four men were arrested on suspicion of child neglect while a fifth man was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The undercover footage showed staff members physically assaulting and verbally abusing young detainees at the youth prison.

The Medway STC is run by the security firm G4S and provides secure accommodation for young people aged between 12 and 18 who have been placed there by the Youth Justice Board. The facility is meant to provide a safe and supportive environment for rehabilitation and education, but the documentary revealed a culture of violence and intimidation.

The footage showed staff members punching and choking young detainees, as well as using foul language and racial slurs towards them. One staff member was seen repeatedly pushing a young person's head into his own urine in a toilet, while another attempted to strangle a detainee.

The documentary also highlighted the lack of accountability within the facility, as staff members often failed to report incidents of abuse or covered them up. It was revealed that some employees had even been involved in previous incidents of abuse, yet were allowed to continue working with vulnerable young people.

Following the broadcast, the government announced a full-scale review of the youth justice system in England and Wales. G4S immediately suspended 11 employees, including the four men arrested, and promised a thorough investigation into the allegations.

This case of abuse at the Medway STC raised serious concerns about the treatment and welfare of young offenders in the UK. It shed light on the need for better training and supervision of staff in such facilities, as well as stronger accountability measures to prevent incidents of abuse from occurring in"
"Iram Shahzad, 32, admitted two charges at St Albans Crown Court after Spencer Bell was killed as he tried to help a man who had fallen from a bridge.
Mr Bell, 71, died instantly when he was struck by Shahzad's car, in January last year.
Shahzad was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment, suspended for two years.
The court heard the mother of three had sped up to the scene of the tragedy and then tried to get round the slowing cars.
Travelling at speeds of between 82 and 88mph with two of her young children in the back of the car, she realised at the last moment the way ahead was blocked by two stationary vehicles.
But instead of stopping like the other drivers, Shahzad thought she could beat the hold up by swerving back into lane two.
Her car then hit Mr Bell, an ex-policeman and charity worker, who had gone to the aid of Alan Trethewey, 67.
Mr Bell died instantly, the court heard.
On Friday, judge Martin Griffith told her: ""This case is a tragic case for the family and friends of Spencer Bell.""
He said the term Good Samaritan was frequently over-used but in Mr Bell's case it was a fitting description.
""Nothing I can say or do can fill the void left by this splendid man's untimely death,"" he told her.
He disqualified her from driving for 18 months.
Mr Bell's wife Wendy told the court: ""My life has ended. Once it was full of laughter and giggles, chatting all day long and happiness. Now it is misery, sadness and tears.""
Sebastian Gardiner, defending, said his client was truly remorseful and her driving that morning had been out of character.","Iram Shahzad, 32, admitted two charges at St Albans Crown Court after Spencer Bell was killed as he tried to help a man who had fallen from a bridge. Mr Shahzad pleaded guilty to charges of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. The incident happened on November 12, 2021, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK.

According to the prosecution, Shahzad was driving at excessive speed and under the influence of drugs when he hit Spencer Bell. Mr. Bell, a 71-year-old retired man, had stopped his car to assist another driver who had fallen from a bridge onto the road.

Witnesses at the scene described the impact as ""horrific"" and stated that Shahzad did not make any attempt to stop or check on the injured parties. Instead, he fled the scene in his damaged vehicle.

Spencer Bell was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other driver involved in the initial incident suffered serious injuries.

During the trial, Shahzad expressed remorse for his actions and pleaded guilty to both charges. His defense lawyers argued that he panicked and made irrational decisions in the heat of the moment.

The judge, Justice Michael Briggs, warned Shahzad that he could face a significant prison sentence due to the seriousness of the offenses. The case has been adjourned, and Shahzad is due to be sentenced on a later date."

Argyle secured Wednesday's replay with Liverpool after drawing 0-0 at Anfield on 8 January against the youngest-ever side fielded by the Reds.
""It's been very difficult for us,"" Adams said after the Stevenage win.
""We've got people talking about the Liverpool game since we drew at Anfield and everybody else around the place forgot about the Stevenage game.

Plymouth have extended the loans of Bristol City striker Paul-Arnold Garita and Reading midfielder Craig Tanner until the end of the season.
Garita, 21, has scored two goals in 14 appearances for the Pilgrims but missed a penalty in Argyle's FA Cup second-round replay against Newport County.
Tanner, who spent all of last season on loan at Home Park, has netted five times for the Pilgrims this season.
The 22-year-old's contract at Reading runs out in the summer.

The Pilgrims were considered underdogs going into the game, as they are a League Two team while Liverpool is a top-flight Premier League side.

However, Argyle showed great determination and resilience as they mounted a comeback in the second half. Liverpool initially took a 2-0 lead with goals from their star players, but the Pilgrims refused to surrender.

"They have been fighting to take the city, about 30km (20 miles) south of Turkey, from IS since late 2016.
Ten Turkish soldiers have been killed since Wednesday in the fighting.
It is part of a broader offensive by Turkey to push IS and Kurdish fighters away from Turkey's southern border.
Syrian forces meanwhile have closed in on al-Bab from the south, where there is reported to be fierce fighting.
Syrian troops and the pro-Turkish rebels supported by Turkish soldiers are now within 3km of each other on opposite sides of al-Bab, the Associated Press news agency says.
Although Turkey opposes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the war, reports suggest the two sides have reached an accommodation over al-Bab, orchestrated by Syria's key ally, Russia.
Syria is expected to be high on the agenda when the new director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Mike Pompeo, holds with Turkish officials in Ankara on Thursday.
The visit is Mr Pompeo's first trip abroad since taking office. While the US and Turkey are part of the same anti-IS coalition, Turkey objects to US support for the predominantly Kurdish Syria Democratic Forces (SDF), whose People's Protection Units (YPG) contingent is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey.
Turkish and rebel sources, and a UK-based monitoring group, said their forces had taken areas in the western outskirts of al-Bab on Wednesday.
A rebel commander told Reuters news agency that fighters from a pro-Turkish division of the Free Syrian Army were moving forward on Thursday from territory they had taken the day before.
The advances come after Syrian forces cut the main IS supply route into al-Bab, the group's last major stronghold in Aleppo province, earlier this week.
Five Turkish soldiers were killed on Thursday, and five the previous day, Turkish media say.","They have been fighting to take the city, about 30km (20 miles) south of Turkey, from IS since late 2016. Ten Turkish soldiers have been killed since Wednesday in the intense fighting to retake the city from ISIS. The ongoing conflict has been marked by heavy casualties on both sides, with the Turkish military sustaining considerable losses in recent days.

Despite facing fierce resistance from ISIS fighters, Turkish forces have made significant progress in their efforts to recapture the city. They have managed to gain control of key strategic locations and have inflicted substantial damage on ISIS positions.

The loss of ten soldiers in just a few days highlights the intensity and difficulty of the battle. It also underscores the dedication and bravery of the Turkish soldiers involved in the operation.

The fight to retake the city from ISIS has been ongoing for several years, with Turkish forces conducting sporadic offensives and airstrikes to weaken the terrorist group's hold on the area. However, this recent offensive appears to be one of the largest and most concentrated efforts to liberate the city.

The loss of Turkish soldiers is a grim reminder of the sacrifices made in the fight against ISIS. Turkey's determination to eradicate the terrorist group from its borders remains steadfast, and they continue to work with international partners to achieve this goal.

As the battle for the city rages on, the situation remains highly volatile and unpredictable. Both sides are engaged in fierce combat, with the outcome of the conflict uncertain. However, the Turkish military remains committed to the fight and is determined to reclaim the city from ISIS control."
"Any spending reductions will be reflected in the Welsh government's budget, under a spending formula.
Commenting on Twitter, Welsh government Finance Minister Jane Hutt said this was ""more bad news for Wales"".
But the UK government said Wales was ""thriving"" under ""our long-term plan"" and must contribute to the savings.
Chancellor George Osborne is exempting spending on health and schools in England, which limits the impact of any cuts on Wales.
Defence and overseas aid budgets are also being protected from the cuts, of up to £20bn, to be announced when Mr Osborne unveils his spending review in November.
Ms Hutt said: ""The late timing of the spending review makes the challenge of managing the impact of further austerity even greater.
""£20bn cuts to public spending on top of £12bn of welfare cuts set out earlier this month.""
""Cuts on the back of successive reductions to our Budget over the last five years have seen £1.3bn taken out of vital public services in Wales,"" Ms Hutt added.
The UK Treasury has said it wants unprotected departments to draw up two separate models, to plan for cuts of 25% and 40%.
Responding to Ms Hutt's criticism, a UK government spokesperson said: ""Our long-term plan has created the conditions under which Wales is thriving.
""This spending review is the next step in our plans to eliminate the deficit, run a surplus and ensure Britain lives within its means.
""All parts of Britain will need to play their part in making us more secure through finding efficiency savings whilst ensuring that spending is targeted at frontline services.""","Any spending reductions will be reflected in the Welsh government's budget, under a spending formula. Commenting on Twitter, Welsh government Finance Minister Jane Hutt said this was ""more bad news for our public services and for the people of Wales."" She expressed concern that the spending reductions would put additional strain on already stretched public services.

Hutt also highlighted the impact of previous spending reductions on Welsh communities, noting that Wales has had to deal with years of austerity measures imposed by the UK government. She emphasized that these reductions have had severe consequences for essential public services such as healthcare, education, and social care.

The Finance Minister argued that the Welsh government has consistently worked to protect public services and prioritize spending on vital areas. However, she expressed frustration at the lack of control that the Welsh government has over its own budget due to the funding formula set by the UK government.

Hutt called for a fair and equitable funding arrangement that takes into account the specific needs and challenges faced by Wales. She emphasized the importance of investing in public services to support economic recovery and social well-being in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, Hutt's comment reflects the concerns of the Welsh government regarding the impact of spending reductions on their ability to provide essential services to the people of Wales. It also highlights their desire for a more flexible and responsive funding system that better meets the needs of the region."
"It extended an extremely rare invitation to the world's media to come to Pyongyang to see a major military parade.
Officials here used the event to attack the ""imperialist"" United States, as they have done on many previous occasions.
But North Korea also gave the world a glimpse of something new: it unveiled the man many believe will be this country's next leader.
Kim Jong-un is tipped to succeed Kim Jong-il, his father - and North Korea's current leader - who is believed to be in poor health.
Getting accurate information out of one of the world's most secretive states is not easy.
Journalists, analysts and foreign governments often have to read between the lines or work out the meaning of symbolic events.
Last month Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general and given senior positions in the government and the Korean Workers' Party. Many thought then that the younger Mr Kim would eventually succeed his father.
This weekend foreign journalists had a chance to confirm that suspicion when they were unexpectedly allowed to visit North Korea.
Just hours after landing in Pyongyang's shabby airport - there is little air traffic - we were whisked to a special performance of the Arirang Games.
Annual performances take place over a series of weeks involving tens of thousands of singers, acrobats and gymnasts in an open-air stadium.
Koreans 'don't want' young Kim
Profile: Kim Jong-un
For Saturday night's show the venue was ringed with soldiers carrying machine guns. There were security checks for the audience.
Inside there seemed to be a selection of North Korea's most important people: army officers in full uniform and civilians in sharp suits.
During one part of the show the lights suddenly shone on the seats reserved for the most important guests.
There was Kim Jong-il, known as the ""Dear Leader"", and with him was his third son, Kim Jong-un. The audience turned their heads to look and then cheered.
The two men appeared together again on Sunday at the military parade, which took place in Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square - named after the current leader's father, the founder of North Korea.
The parade was organised to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.
North Korea used the event to show off some of its military hardware. There were rocket launchers, missiles and tanks spewing smoke.
There were also thousands of goose-stepping soldiers, marching in perfect unison. The ground shook as they filed past the main podium, where Kim Jong-il and his son were watching.
As the parade ended, many of those who had taken part surged forward towards the podium and began chanting Kim Jong-il's name.
Many were crying, although in a country where complete acceptance of the current leadership is essential, it is not clear whether they were genuinely moved.
Kim Jong-il responded to the call and came forward, clapping his hands and waving. He looked frail as he walked along the viewing platform with a noticeable limp.
He is reported to have had a stroke in 2008. If he is ill, it could explain why he is so keen to rapidly promote his third son, who is only in his late twenties.
Until recently Kim Jong-un was hardly known even inside North Korea, but people here are already referring to him as the ""Young General"".
It might not be long before the Kims extend their family's iron rule over North Korea for another generation.","It extended an extremely rare invitation to the world's media to come to Pyongyang to see a major military parade. Officials here used the event to attack the ""imperialist"" United States and showcase their military strength. The parade included the display of intercontinental ballistic missiles and other advanced weaponry, sending a clear message to the international community. North Korean officials condemned the US for its aggressive stance and claimed that they were prepared to defend their sovereignty at all costs. The event also served as a platform for the regime to rally domestic support and boost nationalistic sentiment. Despite international concerns over North Korea's nuclear program, the country remains defiant and determined to maintain its military capabilities."

"It is part of an attempt to encourage Muslim women to consider pursing a career in the force.
Officers and police staff have always had the option to wear religious headwear but the announcement ratifies the use of the hijab.
Chief Constable Phil Gormley said the police force should be representative of the communities it serves.
The move comes 10 years after the Metropolitan Police in London approved a uniform hijab.
Mr Gormley said: ""I hope that this addition to our uniform options will contribute to making our staff mix more diverse and adds to the life skills, experiences and personal qualities that our officers and staff bring to policing the communities of Scotland.""
The announcement was welcomed by the Scottish Police Muslim Association's chairman Fahad Bashir.
He said: ""This is a positive step in the right direction, and I am delighted that Police Scotland is taking productive steps in order to ensure that our organisation is seen to be inclusive and represents the diverse communities that we serve across Scotland.
""No doubt this will encourage more women from Muslim and minority ethnic backgrounds to join Police Scotland.""
There are currently six female Muslim officers working for Police Scotland - but none of them wear the hijab either on duty or outwith the force. The most recent figure for the overall strength of the force - released at the end of June - was 17,242.
Official figures showed that there were 127 applications from black, Asian and ethnic minority candidates in 2015-16. That was just 2.6% of the total number applying to work for the force.
In order to reflect the 4% figure across Scottish society, the force said it would need to recruit an additional 650 ethnic minority candidates.","It is part of an attempt to encourage Muslim women to consider pursing a career in the force. Officers and police staff have always had the option to wear religious head coverings, such as a hijab, as part of their uniform. However, until now, there has been limited representation of Muslim women in the police force.

By allowing Muslim women to wear a hijab as part of their police uniform, it sends a positive message of inclusivity and diversity within the force. This step aims to break down barriers and encourage Muslim women to see themselves as valued members of law enforcement.

This change is important for several reasons. Firstly, it allows Muslim women to feel more comfortable and confident while pursuing a career in the police force. By incorporating their religious beliefs into their uniform, it enables them to fully express their identity and faith without compromising their professional aspirations.

Secondly, it promotes cultural understanding and fosters better community relations. By having police officers who wear hijabs, it sends a message of acceptance and respect for different religious practices. This can help build trust and improve communication between the police and Muslim communities, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and united society.

Lastly, by actively encouraging Muslim women to join the police force, it increases diversity within law enforcement. Having a diverse police force is crucial for effectively serving a diverse population. Different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences can contribute to more effective problem-solving and decision-making.

In conclusion, allowing Muslim women to wear hijabs as part of their police uniform is a step towards creating a more inclusive and representative police force. It aims to empower Muslim women to pursue careers in law enforcement while promoting understanding and unity within communities."
"Kromtech - the Germany-based firm behind MacKeeper - has acknowledged that its customers' names, internet addresses and login credentials were among the data  exposed.
However, it said that users' payment details were ""never at risk"".
The firm believes the details were accessed only by the security expert who alerted it to the problem.
""The privacy and security of our clients' information remains our top priority and from the moment we were aware of the access, we immediately took several proactive steps to identify and correct the issue,"" it said in a statement.
""We want to offer a special 'thank you' to security researcher Chris Vickery for identifying the security breach attempt so that we could stop it before anyone was harmed.""
Mr Vickery told security blogger Brian Krebs that he had discovered 21 gigabytes of MacKeeper user data ""after spending a few bored moments searching for database servers"" that were not password-protected. He was able to do this by using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices.
Mr Krebs reported that Kromtech initially said that 13 million customers' details had been exposed.
That figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both ""active and non-active"" users.
MacKeeper is widely promoted on the web - including in prominent adverts on Ookla's Speedtest site - as a way to ""clean"" and ""protect"" Macintosh computers in order to help them run faster.
However, critics have claimed that the software can cause computers to slow down and crash, and can be problematic to remove.

Defence lawyers have withdrawn from new criminal cases requiring legal aid in protest at the changes.
The ongoing dispute has stalled about 800 cases due to be heard in the Crown Court.
A two-day process aimed at resolving a stand-off, will take place within the next fortnight.
It is understood that both sides have agreed on an English QC to act as mediator.
Some solicitors' firms have also joined in the industrial action.
Senior judges adjourned an ongoing court challenge to the new rules for legal aid fees in Northern Ireland after being informed of the development.
Judicial review proceedings were launched by the Bar Council and the Law Society in a joint bid to have the new payment arrangements quashed.
In November 2015, a High Court judge held that the rules do not provide fair pay to defence solicitors in some criminal cases.
He also identified a breach in the impact assessment carried out as part of the reforms.
However, despite declaring the decision making process unlawful in two areas, he declined to quash the rules.
An appeal against his verdict was due to begin this week in front of three senior judges in Belfast.
On Friday, following a suggestion put to the parties by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, it was confirmed that mediation is to take place.
The Court of Appeal was told the Bar Council, Law Society and the Department of Justice have all signed up.
On that basis, legal proceedings were put on hold.

Defence lawyers have withdrawn from new criminal cases requiring legal aid in protest against the cuts. The move has led to concerns about the potential impact it may have on access to justice for defendants in Northern Ireland.

The cuts implemented by Justice Minister David Ford aimed to reduce the legal aid bill in Northern Ireland, which had risen significantly in recent years. The changes included reducing fees paid to barristers and solicitors, as well as imposing stricter financial eligibility criteria for defendants seeking legal aid.

In response to these cuts, defence lawyers in Northern Ireland decided to withdraw from new criminal cases requiring legal aid. They argued that the reduced fees would make it financially unviable for them to continue operating and provide quality representation to defendants. This decision has led to a shortage of available defence lawyers, raising concerns about the potential impact on defendants' right to a fair trial.

Critics argue that the cuts to legal aid undermine the principle of equal access to justice. They claim that defendants from disadvantaged backgrounds may struggle to find competent legal representation without adequate funding. This could lead to a potential imbalance between the prosecution and defence, compromising the fairness of the criminal justice system.

Proponents of the cuts argue that they were necessary to address the excessive spending on legal aid and ensure a sustainable system. They claim that the previous levels of legal aid fees were unsustainable and represented a burden on taxpayers. They argue that with the revised payment structure, lawyers can still provide adequate representation while also ensuring value for money.

"Colin Gregg, 75, from Gosforth, Newcastle, had denied indecently assaulting four boys while working as a teacher, beginning in 1963.
A jury at Leeds Crown Court found him guilty after a trial lasting almost a month. He was told jail was inevitable.
He had been accused of nine counts of indecent assault on boys aged between 10 and 14.
Gregg, the son of the founder of the Greggs bakery chain, was released on bail and will be sentenced on 30 March.
The court heard he abused one child in a swimming pool and others in a gym at his home.
'Position of trust'
He claimed to be the victim of a ""police witch hunt"" and had previously been found not guilty of a similar offence in 1997.
Gregg showed no reaction as he stood in the dock and heard the verdicts, which were returned after almost 12 hours of jury deliberations.
The jury was told how he used to be head teacher at The King's School Junior School, in Tynemouth, and also taught at Durham School.
He also worked as a social worker in Newcastle.
Judge Robin Mairs told Gregg the fact he was granting bail was no indication of sentence.
He said: ""These are serious matters and a custodial sentence is inevitable.""
John Dilworth, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Throughout his life, Colin Gregg has been a successful businessman, respected teacher and committed charity worker.
""Those achievements have won him the gratitude of the community but, beneath his respectable veneer, he was sexually abusing young boys with alarming regularity.
""Colin Gregg exploited his position in society to abuse young boys, using them for his own sexual gratification. ""
The trial at Leeds was a retrial, after a jury in Newcastle failed to reach a verdict last year.
Northumbria Police said Gregg was ""in a position of trust which he used to sexually exploit children"".
A spokesman for children's charity the NSPCC said: ""Gregg shamelessly betrayed the trust vulnerable young children placed in him and his sickening campaign of abuse will have had life-long effects on his victims.
""It is thanks to their bravery in speaking out that he's finally been brought to justice.

"Georgina Dodd, 69, of Lairg, in Sutherland, has been ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work.
She must also wear an electronic tag for the next 120 days as an alternative to a prison sentence.
Tain Sheriff Court heard that Dodd embezzled the money from Childless Overcome Through Surrogacy (COTS).
She set up the charity with her husband Michael in 1984 after their son, John, was born to a surrogate mother.
COTS offered support and services to childless couples who had to pay a membership fee and annual subscription to the charity.
Between January 2005 and October 2006, Dodd ""frittered away"" £50,000 her lawyer Liam Robertson told Sheriff Chris Dickson.
Mr Robertson said: ""It is as simple as that. She can't explain where it went. But she accepts full and unfettered responsibility.""
The court heard that Dodd set up a secret account in the charity's name and also wrote cheques to herself from the official COTS account.
She also moved funds to accounts in her son's name, but he did not know where the money had come from, the court heard.
Dodd had earlier admitted embezzling £50,000 and sentence was deferred until Monday for a background report.
Sheriff Dickson told Dodd he would not jail her because there was an alternative open to him.
He explained that it was because she was a first offender, at low risk of re-offending and she had repaid £15,000 of the money.
But he added: ""I also take into account your personal circumstance and the testimonials on your behalf.
""You are the primary carer for your husband and your sister-in-law and this matter has been hanging over your head for a considerable time.""","Georgina Dodd, 69, of Lairg, in Sutherland, has been ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid community work. She must also wear an electronic tag for the next 120 days after being found guilty of theft.

Dodd, a retired school teacher, was caught stealing groceries from her local supermarket on three separate occasions. The total value of the stolen goods amounted to over £200 ($275).

During the trial, it was revealed that Dodd had been struggling financially due to a reduction in her pension and increasing living costs. However, the court was not convinced that these circumstances justified her criminal behavior.

In addition to the community work and electronic tag, Dodd has been ordered to attend a rehabilitation program aimed at addressing her underlying issues and preventing reoffending. She has also been warned that any further criminal behavior could result in a custodial sentence.

Dodd's defense lawyer argued that she was deeply remorseful for her actions and had already suffered significant public humiliation as a result of the trial. However, the judge emphasized the seriousness of theft, regardless of the offender's age or background. He stated that the punishment should serve as a deterrent for both Dodd and others who may consider committing similar crimes.

Dodd, who has no previous convictions, has accepted the sentence and expressed her commitment to completing the community work and rehabilitation program. She hopes to use this experience as an opportunity for personal growth and to regain the trust and respect of her community."

"In April 2015, it became an offence to share private sexual photographs or films without the subject's consent.
The BBC analysed Freedom of Information requests from 31 forces in England and Wales between April and December.
Online safety charities said victims were left ""hugely damaged"".
Revenge porn refers to the act of a partner or ex-partner purposefully distributing images or videos of a sexual nature without the other person's consent.

The new law was introduced after campaigners lobbied MPs to make it a criminal offence.
Previously, convictions for this type of offence were sought under existing copyright or harassment laws.
It covers images shared on and offline without the subject's permission and with the intent to cause harm. Physical distribution of images is also covered.
An NSPCC spokesman said: ""It is shocking that children as young as 11 are becoming victims of revenge porn - and underlines the urgent need for action by social media sites to improve safety.
""Young people also need to be aware of the serious risks of sending explicit material or photos of themselves.""
Laura Higgins, of the Revenge Porn Helpline, said being a victim was a ""hugely distressing, damaging and violating experience"".
She said: ""The effect on victims is often pervasive and long-lasting.
""Whilst they have been the victim of a crime, often individuals internalise feelings of guilt and shame, which can negatively affect an individual's sense of self-worth and self-esteem.
""Victim-blaming attitudes only exacerbate these feelings.  Some feel so isolated and overwhelmed they consider suicide.""
Ms Higgins said the new legislation was flawed because it did not ensure the anonymity of the victim; it did not cover historical cases; and it did not cover images that had been altered via Photoshop.
The English Regions data unit analysed data from police forces in England and Wales. Some 31 responded - Dorset, Hampshire and Lincolnshire denied the request on cost grounds, while responses from Avon and Somerset, Leicestershire, Bedfordshire, Cleveland, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Dyfed Powys and Gwent Police remain outstanding.
There were wide variations in the charge rate among police forces.  Nobody had so far been charged in Lancashire, Devon and Cornwall or Cumbria, for example. In the West Midlands, 25% of reported offences resulted in a charge, while in Staffordshire, the rate dropped to 3%.
Simon Kempton, the lead on cyber crime for the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ""While some officers have had training in the new legislation across the board, there have been some inconsistencies, and there may be some officers who are yet to be given a full awareness and understanding of the new offence.""
Mr Kempton said the federation welcomed the new legislation.
""Any sexual offences, including revenge porn, can have a devastating effect on victims. Until the new offence was enacted, police officers were often unable to show a criminal offence had taken place,"" he said.
A petition urging a change in the law to give victims the right to anonymity has been launched by the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, Julia Mulligan, and a revenge-porn victim.
Media outlets routinely withhold the names of victims.
Dr Emma Short, the director of the National Centre for Cyber-Stalking at the University of Bedfordshire, is conducting a survey into the effect revenge porn has on its victims.
She said: ""The number of young people affected is an area for great concern, but the figures probably only represent the tip of the iceberg.
""Sending 'nudes' in dating or pre-dating relationships has become something of a norm for young people aged 18 and under.""
The Crown Prosecution Service was contacted for a comment, but has not yet responded.
Reporting team: Paul Bradshaw, Peter Sherlock, Sandro Sorrentino","In April 2015, it became an offence to share private sexual photographs or films without the subject's consent. The BBC analysed Freedom of Information requests from 31 forces in England and found that between April 2015 and December 2017, there were 1,160 cases of revenge porn reported to the police. However, only 214 resulted in the suspect being charged and only 104 led to a prosecution.

The analysis also revealed that there were significant differences between police forces in their response to revenge porn. Some forces saw a high rate of charges and prosecutions, while others had very low numbers. For example, Greater Manchester had the highest number of charges with 38, followed by the Metropolitan Police with 34. However, some forces such as Dorset and North Yorkshire had zero charges during that period.

There were also concerns raised about the low number of cases that resulted in charges and prosecutions. Campaigners argued that the law was not being effectively enforced and that victims were not getting justice. They suggested that more training should be provided to police officers on the issue and that victims should be better supported.

The police acknowledged the challenges in dealing with revenge porn cases, including issues around victim reluctance to come forward, difficulties in gathering evidence, and the involvement of international jurisdictions. They stated that they were working to improve their response to these cases and to raise awareness among both the public and officers.

Overall, the analysis highlighted the limitations and varied response of police forces in handling revenge porn cases. It underscored the need for consistent and effective enforcement of the law to protect victims and hold perpetrators accountable."
"Caledonian MacBrayne, Pentland Ferries and Northlink Ferries said high winds could affect services for the remainder of the day.
A yellow ""be aware"" warning for wind in the north and west of Scotland has been issued by the Met Office.
It has also warned of icy conditions across the country overnight.
Forecasters said the Highlands and Strathclyde could expect of gusts of up to 60mph between 11:00 and 22:00.
They could reach speeds of 75mph in the Western Isles.
The Met Office said it could lead to disruption to road, air and ferry transport and power cuts were possible.
Its chief forecaster said ""severe gales"" would affect the west of Scotland in the early evening.
They added: ""The strongest wind gusts are likely over and to the north of high ground, and in coastal areas exposed to this wind direction.""
Caledonian MacBrayne said 23 of its 26 routes were likely to be disrupted or cancelled.
There was a ""probability of weather disruption and possible cancellation"" on Northlink Ferries' services between Orkney, Shetland and the mainland.
Pentland Ferries' sailings from St Margarets Hope and Gills Bay in Orkney have also been affected.
And flights due to land at Barra airport were cancelled, according to its Twitter feed.
A Met Office yellow warning for ice overnight and into Tuesday morning has also been issued.
It will lead to hazardous conditions on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths across large parts of Scotland, forecasters warned.
Up to 5cm (2in) of snow is also likely to fall on high ground, above 300m, in the southern and eastern Highlands, which may affect transport routes, they added.
They warned that the very highest routes could be hit by 10cm (4in) of snow, as well as wind, which could lead to drifting.

"The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed the ex-Capital FM chart show host acted ""strangely"" towards certain women he worked with.
She was one of several witnesses to describe alleged incidents, including ""inappropriate sexual comments"".
Mr Fox, 54, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.
Giving evidence at Westminster Magistrates' Court, the former colleague said she had been told about Mr Fox, from south-west London,  refusing to comply with instructions unless an alleged victim made her breasts ""speak to him"".
""It just seemed so strange,"" she said.
""I heard him say things on occasions that I didn't think were that appropriate. It was just telling girls that they looked good but in quite a pervy way.""
The witness said she sent a text message to friends after she allegedly saw ""Foxy"" - as he was known to listeners and colleagues - smell a woman's hair.
The court heard the witness told her friends she ""nearly puked in his face"" when she saw the alleged incident.
Another witness described how there was a culture of ""boy banter"" at Capital, and that a complaint against Mr Fox was allegedly ""brushed under the carpet"" to protect his name.
Asked by defence counsel Jonathan Caplan QC to elaborate on how his client was a ""challenging"" colleague to work with, the witness said: ""I didn't know Neil very well and hadn't worked with him for very long, but I felt that he was a bit of a bully.""
Another witness described how Mr Fox had allegedly made ""inappropriate sexual comments and brushed up against"" his friend, an alleged victim, in a sexual manner.
The court also heard from a former colleague who alleged he had kissed her bare shoulder.
Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman described how she was washing up a coffee mug in a small communal kitchen when the incident happened.
She told the court it made her feel ""really gross"".
When asked by Mr Caplan whether she thought the matter should be dealt with at a disciplinary hearing rather than a court case, she replied: ""What happened to me was bad and shouldn't have happened.
""But for me, I don't think what he did was that bad.""
She said female colleagues were told ""early on just to be wary"" of Mr Fox's behaviour.
The trial continues.","The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed the ex-Capital FM chart show host acted ""strangely"" towards certain women he worked with. She was one of several witnesses who came forward to testify against the former host. According to her, he often made inappropriate and uncomfortable comments, as well as engaging in unwanted physical contact.

The woman described instances when he would stare or make suggestive remarks that made her feel uneasy. She also recalled an incident where he touched her inappropriately during a work event, leaving her shocked and violated.

Additionally, she mentioned witnessing similar behavior towards other female colleagues, including instances of him touching them inappropriately or making inappropriate comments about their appearance. These actions created a hostile and uncomfortable work environment for the women he targeted.

The woman's testimony, along with that of the other witnesses, was crucial in building a case against the ex-host. Their accounts shed light on his pattern of behavior and demonstrated a consistent disregard for appropriate workplace conduct.

By coming forward, the women displayed immense bravery and helped ensure that the ex-host would face the consequences of his actions. Their testimonies were instrumental in proving the allegations against him and seeking justice for the victims."
"Under the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000 all parties need to confirm their registration details with the Electoral Commission.
But despite having six months notice, the BNP missed the deadline.
BNP spokesman Stephen Squire said: ""It's the first I've heard of it - it's obviously an oversight.""
But former BNP leader Nick Griffin, who was expelled by the party in 2014, told LBC Radio the mistake was ""either incompetence or it's a combination of a deliberate wrecking job which has been going on over the last year or so.""
However, BNP chairman Adam Walker, in a fundraising email to party supporters, said the ""media frenzy"" created by the technical oversight ""proves how relevant and newsworthy the BNP is"".
By law, the Electoral Commission has to remove from its register any political party that fails to submit its details.
Such a waste?
The BNP's statement of accounts were due on 7 July 2015, but despite a six-month window, the party had still not paid up by the final deadline on 7 January 2016, forcing the commission to take action.
Removal from the register means BNP candidates cannot use the party's name, description or emblems on ballot papers at elections.
But, a commission spokesman said if the party re-registered in the near future, its candidates would be able to stand under the BNP banner at this May's local elections.
However, if they wish to stand before the registration is considered, BNP candidates will have to stand as independents.
Mr Squire suggested the party had too much to lose to let its registration lapse further.
""After battling for 30 years to get the debate on immigration going, we don't want to waste it on a technicality,"" he said.
Party names and identities are protected for two years under the 2000 Act to prevent other parties using them.
Nick Griffin stepped down as BNP leader in July 2014 after 15 years at the top. His decision came after he lost his seat in the European Parliament and the party saw its vote collapse in that year's local elections.
But months of infighting followed and Mr Griffin was expelled from the BNP amid accusations that he had tried to ""destabilise"" the party.","Under the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000 all parties need to confirm their registration details with the Electoral Commission. But despite having six months notice, the BNP missed the deadline to confirm their registration details in 2010. As a result, they were removed from the Electoral Commission's register of political parties and were no longer able to contest elections under the BNP name or use the party's logo on ballot papers.

The BNP's failure to meet the registration deadline was widely seen as a significant setback for the party. It was criticized for its organizational incompetence and lack of attention to administrative details. Some argued that this reflected the party's overall decline and loss of influence in British politics.

The Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000 aims to ensure transparency and accountability in the political process by requiring parties to provide accurate and up-to-date registration information. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in removal from the electoral register.

During the period of their removal, the BNP could not contest elections or receive certain types of funding available to registered parties. However, it is worth noting that the party has since re-registered and continued to participate in elections under different names, such as the British Democratic Party.

Overall, the BNP's missed registration deadline in 2010 was a significant blow to their political standing and demonstrated the importance of complying with electoral regulations."
"The Anglo-Norman castle was originally built in the 12th Century by John De Courcy.
At one stage it was virtually a ruin but was restored in the 19th century and further renovated in recent years.
The application is for an eight bedroom hotel with permission to use a courtyard for events such as weddings.
A community consultation report submitted with the application says the hotel might be more accurately described as ""a private venue which could be hired on request"".
The application is made in the name of Mullahead Property Company Ltd, a firm associated with the owners of the Tayto crisp brand.
It adds that Tayto also intend to use the venue for visiting customers and for training and conference purposes.","The Anglo-Norman castle was originally built in the 12th Century by John De Courcy. At one stage it was virtually a ruin but was restored in the 19th century and is now one of the best-preserved medieval castles in Ireland. The castle is located in County Down, Northern Ireland, and sits on a rocky outcrop overlooking the town of Downpatrick.

John De Courcy, a Norman knight, constructed the castle in 1183 as a stronghold to consolidate his power in the region. The original castle featured a large keep, curtain walls, and a moat. However, over time, the castle fell into disrepair and was largely abandoned.

"People will be able to order Argos products online, and then collect them in the supermarket locations the same or the following day, Argos said.
Sainsbury's has seen strong demand for non-food products over the past three years.
And in November it found that 6% of shop-floor space was being under-used.
The supermarket giant aims to fill half of that space with clothing lines, and devote half of the space to general merchandise.
""These 10 Argos stores will complement our supermarket offer, giving customers the opportunity to shop for an extended range of non-food items,"" said Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's.
Argos customers can already order products online to be delivered by post, or can opt for so-called 'click-and-collect' - which Argos calls 'check and reserve'.
Check and reserve is important to Argos - it accounts for a third of Argos' total sales.
The digital pilot, which will be in 10 Sainsbury's supermarkets with a floor space of between 30,000 to 100,000 square feet, will be in shops dotted around the UK.
Possible locations of the concessions have been identified, and should be announced within the next few weeks, a Sainsbury's spokeswoman said.
The concessions are likely to be located in areas which are further away from existing Argos shops.
Around 1,000 products will be held in stock in the supermarket, and about 20,000 products will be available to collect the same or following day. Products that are not held in the supermarket will be delivered from one of 140 larger Argos stores.
Argos has ten concessions in Homebase DIY stores - both companies are part of the Home Retail Group.
Sainsbury's already has concessions from around 30 different firms in its shops.
Shoe repair firm Timpson, camera company Jessops, and Virgin Holidays and Thomas Cook travel agents all operate Sainsbury's concessions.
In November, Sainsbury's reined back plans for new shops, saying that like-for-like sales had fallen in the half-year.","People will be able to order Argos products online, and then collect them in the supermarket locations the same or the following day, Argos said. Sainsbury's has seen strong demand for online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, and this partnership with Argos will help them meet the increasing demand. The move will also benefit Argos, as it will expand its reach and make its products more accessible to customers in convenient locations. This collaboration reflects the growing trend of retailers joining forces to enhance their online capabilities and provide customers with a seamless shopping experience."
"A report in the science magazine Nature suggests more than half of Mr Ponta's work was made up of copied text.
Mr Ponta has strenuously denied the allegations and resisted calls for his resignation.
He says the claims are politically motivated and says President Traian Basescu is behind them.
The British-based magazine says it has been shown documents by an anonymous whistleblower that shows that ""substantial"" sections of text on the workings of the International Criminal Court are ""identical"" to material written by other law scholars.
It says the evidence shows that more than half of the 432-page thesis for Mr Ponta's doctorate at the University of Bucharest was copied.
The study was published in book form in 2004, and also formed the basis of a 2010 book on liability in international humanitarian law.
A former PhD student, Daniela Coman, is named as co-author.
The magazine quoted Marius Andruh, a chemist at the University of Bucharest and president of the Romanian council for the recognition of university diplomas, as saying: ""The evidence of plagiarism is overwhelming.""
Prime Minister Ponta says the bibliography lists the papers he consulted. He has pointed out the foreword has been written by Ion Diaconu, one of the writers whose work he is accused of plagiarising.
The prime minister said he was prepared to submit his work to the education ministry commission for checks.
""If the commission tells me I wasn't supposed to list the bibliography at the end but insert it as footnotes, of course I will give up my doctor's title immediately. I am not mad about titles, I don't care about this one.
""If this is a mistake, then I am willing to pay for it,"" he told a news conference.
There was ""no way"" he would resign, he added.
Victor Ponta became Romania's third prime minister in less than six months when his left-wing-dominated Social Liberal Union (USL) alliance took charge in May 2012.
The previous government had been unseated in a no-confidence vote, just two months after taking office.
Mr Ponta has vowed to fight ""injustices"" caused by austerity measures of the outgoing cabinet.
Parliamentary elections are due in November.
President Basescu has close links with the centre-right opposition Democrat-Liberal Party (PDL), and Mr Ponta told journalists that trust between the two leaders was ""zero"".
""You know very well this is a pretext of a political war between President Basescu and me, a war each of us leads with their own weapons,"" he said.
Officials in Mr Basescu's office have declined to comment.
Plagiarism charges have forced several European politicians to step down in recent months, including Romania's education minister.
Hungary's president and a German defence minister who was tipped as a possible successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel have also resigned over plagiarism rows.","A report in the science magazine Nature suggests more than half of Mr Ponta's work was made up of copied text. Mr Ponta has strenuously denied the allegations and resisted calls for his resignation. The report, which analyzed Mr Ponta's published scientific articles, found extensive instances of plagiarized content, including entire paragraphs and figures. The researchers responsible for the analysis claimed that around 60% of the text in question was copied from other sources without proper attribution.

Plagiarism is considered a serious offense in the scientific community, as it undermines the integrity and credibility of research. It is not uncommon for scientists to build upon each other's work, but proper acknowledgment and citation are crucial in maintaining transparency and honoring intellectual property rights.

Despite the evidence presented in the report, Mr Ponta has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. He argues that the allegations are politically motivated and an attempt to discredit him. Many of his supporters have echoed his sentiments and believe the accusations are part of a smear campaign against him.

Calls for Mr Ponta's resignation have grown louder following the publication of the Nature report. Critics argue that a leader accused of academic misconduct should not continue holding the position of authority, especially when it involves matters of science and research. They believe that his resignation would not only restore integrity to the scientific community but also send a strong message about the importance of ethics and accountability.

However, Mr Ponta remains defiant and refuses to step down. He argues that he has been a prominent figure in promoting scientific research in the country and has made significant contributions that should not be overshadowed by allegations of plagiarism. He has called for an independent investigation into the claims to prove his innocence.

The controversy surrounding Mr Ponta highlights the need for greater vigilance and scrutiny in scientific publishing. It serves as a reminder that even high-profile individuals can face accusations of academic misconduct. This incident will likely lead to discussions about implementing stricter guidelines and checks to ensure the integrity of scientific research and prevent future instances of plagiarism."

"The claim: Labour was ahead in the polls before the leadership process started.
Reality Check verdict: Labour has been ahead in only three of the 75 polls conducted between Mr Corbyn becoming leader and the end of June.
""Over the past year we have won the by-elections we contested, three with a big swing to Labour, we got ahead of the Tories in the local government election, we won four mayoral contests and were indeed ahead of [sic] the polls until such time as a number of people decided to have a leadership contest instead,"" Mr Corbyn said.
Let's take a look at those claims in turn.
There have been four by-elections since the last general election, all of them in seats that were previously held by Labour. The swings to Labour were 7%, 6%, -1% and 9%.
In the first four by-elections of the last parliament, three of the swings to Labour were in double figures, so the swings are smaller than they were five years ago, but not a huge amount smaller.
Labour remained ahead of the Conservatives in the local government elections in England in 2016 with 1,326 council seats compared with the Tories' 842 seats.
There was some criticism of Labour's performance because they ended up with 18 fewer seats than they had the last time these councils were contested in 2012, although the party had been expected to lose many more seats.
It was nonetheless the first time outside a general election year since 1985 that the main opposition party had lost seats in the annual council elections.
So, while Mr Corbyn's assertion is accurate it does not tell the full story.
Labour has indeed won the four mayoral contests in the past year: in London, Bristol, Salford and Liverpool.
The London mayor was a gain from the Tories, in Bristol Labour's candidate defeated an independent incumbent, while Salford and Liverpool were both Labour holds.
Finally, Mr Corbyn said that Labour had been ahead in the polls until ""people decided to have a leadership election"".
It would be reasonable to take that point as the day of the EU referendum, because it was after that that the moves began for the vote of no confidence and the leadership challenges. Between 12 September when Mr Corbyn became leader and the end of June there have been 75 voting intention polls carried out.
Of those, Labour has been ahead in three, all conducted in March and April by YouGov.
But looking at an average of the polls, the Conservatives have been ahead since the 2015 general election.","The claim: Labour was ahead in the polls before the leadership process started. Reality Check verdict: Labour has been ahead in only three of the 75 polls conducted between Mr Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader in September 2015 and July 2021. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

Between September 2015 and July 2021, numerous polls were conducted to gauge public opinion on the Labour Party's popularity. According to the Reality Check verdict, Labour was ahead in only three out of the 75 polls conducted during this period.

It is important to note that polls often fluctuate, and the party's position in the polls can change based on various factors such as political events, policy announcements, and leadership changes. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the specific timeframe and methodologies used in the polls when assessing Labour's position."
"The company, which makes coyote fur-lined jackets, some of which sell for £900 each, has started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as on Canada's main exchange.
In early trading, shares were more than 40% higher at $18.14.
Founded in Toronto 60 years ago, the company was bought by the private equity group Bain Capital in 2013.
The firm had priced its initial public offering at $12.78 per share.
It raised $256m (£207m) from the share sale which will go towards paying down debt.
The company started off making woollen vests, raincoats and snowmobile suits before moving into Arctic and mountain expedition coats and more recently, luxury jackets.
Animal rights protestors from Peta staged a demonstration outside the New York stock exchange. The group, which objects to its use of coyote fur, plans to buy shares in the company so that it can attend shareholder meetings and influence its policy.
But the company says its fur comes from regulated trappers and not fur farms, while its down ""only comes as a by-product from the poultry industry and has not come from live-plucked or force-fed birds"".
One investor, who did not buy the shares, cautioned about the company's growth prospects.
""It is a very niche product at the high end of the retail market, and the retail market is under pressure overall,"" said Bryden Teich, from Avenue Investment Management.
""In light of an over-indebted Canadian consumer, a really tough retail environment, I have a hard time seeing how it becomes a big growth story.""","The company, which makes coyote fur-lined jackets, some of which sell for £900 each, has started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as on Canada's main exchange. The company, known for its high-end coyote fur-lined jackets, has recently commenced trading on two major stock exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Canada's main exchange now list the company's shares, signaling its entry into the public market.

Renowned for their luxurious and stylish designs, the company's jackets have gained a reputation for their premium quality and price. Some of their products sell for an astonishing £900 each, reflecting the brand's commitment to offering exclusive and prestigious outerwear.

By joining the NYSE, the company gains access to a highly liquid and globally recognized stock exchange. This move enables the company to attract a broader investor base, potentially increasing its market value and raising capital for expansion and growth opportunities.

Simultaneously, trading on Canada's main exchange emphasizes the company's Canadian roots and strengthens its presence in the country's stock market. This dual listing strategy allows them to tap into both the American and Canadian investment ecosystems, maximizing exposure and potential investor interest.

With this strategic decision, the company aims to leverage the power of the public market to support its long-term ambitions. As an internationally recognized brand, trading on these prestigious exchanges solidifies its position as a major player in the luxury fashion industry."

"To launch her campaign last Sunday for forthcoming regional elections, the Front National's Marine Le Pen chose a boat trip on the River Somme, through the market gardens of the northern city of Amiens.
As we chugged along in beautiful late summer sun, she delivered a set-piece speech in time for the evening news - then took questions from the press pack with her customary mix of pugnacity and charm.
I was struck by how little of her speech dealt with the issue that everyone else there was talking about - immigration.
Maybe it is because she feels the argument has already been made and won.
Mostly she spoke of what she would do for social services, unemployment, housing, culture etc - once she were elected president of the North Picardy region (which is what she is gunning for in December's vote).
But for the party faithful with us on the boat, the news from Germany and the east is more evidence that the FN's message on immigration has always been the right one.
""I do not know a single person - in the FN or in any other party - who  wants anything to do with this new wave of immigrants,"" said Vincent Rousseau, an English teacher from Soissons and an FN candidate.
""We have a country whose economy is broken. We cannot welcome more people. There are no jobs for them. There is no future for them. We have had enough.""
Patricia Chagnon, an FN municipal councillor in the town of Abbeville, said many of her constituents were shocked when the socialist mayor of the town agreed to take in some of the new refugees.
""Of course we are distressed by their plight. But I am more distressed by the plight of the poor and elderly in Abbeville. Recently the socialist town hall put up the price of the meals on wheels that the elderly depend on.
""So we now have a situation where we are taking away from our own needy in order to help people who have come from outside.""
It does not take an advanced degree in political science to conclude that the biggest movement of people into Europe in recent history was bound to be good electoral news for the FN.
Even many of the party's most vociferous opponents have expressed fury at Angela Merkel for - in their view - acting as a recruiting sergeant for Marine.
Far from lauding the German chancellor for her humanity in welcoming refugees, many ruling French socialists felt she was being grotesquely irresponsible.
Malek Boutih, who used to head the anti-racist group SOS-Racisme, accused Merkel of selfishly opening the doors in order to make up Germany's demographic deficit - without any thought for the consequences on countries like France.
""In effect Madame Merkel has become the political ally of Madame Le Pen,"" he said.
""Her policy on immigration is so ill-thought-out it is sowing consternation across our country.""
When even socialists admit that too much immigration is a dangerous thing, it is evident that all the FN has to do is sit back and say: ""We told you so.""
Which is exactly what Marine Le Pen did when I asked on the boat how the dramatic recent events would affect French politics.
""If anyone had listened five, 10, 15 years ago to what we have always been saying, then we would not be in this mess today,"" she said.
For one of France's leading experts on the far-right, Jean-Yves Camus, the repercussions of the refugee crisis can only be good news for Marine.
""It is welcome for all the xenophobic parties of Europe, who can say that what is happening now is not immigration.  It is an invasion from the Middle East.

""We can expect a lot more of the fear factor as the elections approach.""
The latest opinion polls make Marine Le Pen favourite to win the Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie region - a victory that would give her big momentum ahead of the presidential race in early 2017.
Marine Le Pen:","To launch her campaign last Sunday for forthcoming regional elections, the Front National's Marine Le Pen chose a boat trip on the River Somme, through the market gardens of the Picardy region. Le Pen's choice of boat trip was symbolic, as the region is known for its agricultural heritage and the Front National has been focusing on issues of agriculture and rural France in its campaign.

During the boat trip, Le Pen spoke about the challenges faced by farmers in the region, including competition from imported produce, bureaucracy, and the need to protect French agricultural traditions. She emphasized the need to support local farmers and promote French agricultural products.

The boat trip also allowed Le Pen to showcase the natural beauty of the region and highlight its potential for tourism. She talked about the importance of developing eco-friendly tourism in the area and promoting the cultural and historical heritage of Picardy.

Le Pen's campaign for the regional elections has focused on issues such as immigration, security, and identity, but she has also stressed the importance of addressing the concerns of rural communities and supporting local economies.

The boat trip on the River Somme was seen as a strategic and symbolic choice for the campaign launch, allowing Le Pen to connect with rural voters and highlight the Front National's commitment to protecting French agriculture and supporting local businesses."
"It brings the total UK assistance to Iraq since June 2014 to £79.5m.
The money will pay for food, medicine, shelter and clothing, and provide clean water and improved sanitation to help prevent the spread of cholera.
Minister Desmond Swayne said ""the world's gaze appears to have wandered"" from the suffering of those in Iraq.
The so-called Islamic State controls swathes of Iraq's territory, and in places where it has implemented its strict interpretation of Sharia, women are forced to wear full veils, public beheadings are common and non-Muslims are forced to choose between paying a special tax, converting or death.
More than eight million people require humanitarian assistance inside Iraq, with 3.2 million Iraqis internally displaced.
Speaking during a visit to the country, Mr Swayne said: ""We cannot separate out what is happening in Iraq from the instability gripping Syria and the wider region.
""The UN's latest appeal is seriously underfunded and we do not want to see more Iraqis being forced to move because they cannot get the help they need where they are.
""Donors must step up to meet the shortfall now, to prevent Iraq's problems spilling over its borders.""
In June, the UN warned that critical aid operations supporting millions of people in Iraq were at risk of shutting down without an urgent increase in funding.
It is appealing for nearly $500m (£330m) to cover the immediate needs of 5.6 million Iraqis for the next six months.","It brings the total UK assistance to Iraq since June 2014 to £79.5m. The money will pay for food, medicine, shelter and clothing, and provide clean water and improved sanitation facilities for the people affected by the conflict in Iraq. The UK's assistance aims to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the ongoing crisis and ensure their basic needs are met. The funds will also support efforts to provide healthcare services and ensure access to education for children affected by the conflict. This financial aid demonstrates the UK's commitment to helping Iraq recover and rebuild, as well as supporting the stability and security of the region."
"Ospreys are third in the Pro12 table following a narrow 20-18 defeat by Leinster on Saturday.
With three games left they seem likely to face an away trip to either Munster or Leinster in the play-offs.
""I'm really positive in the fact, that we are completely in charge of our affairs,"" said Davis.
Losing at home to Leinster was preceded by a shock 13-5 loss at Italian strugglers Treviso.
Against Leinster, Wales fly-half Dan Biggar missed a late penalty to win the game and later said he was ""dazed"" at the time following a blow to the head.
Biggar is being monitored for concussion ahead of their Pro12 Judgement Day game against Cardiff Blues at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Saturday.
Davis added: ""If someone had asked me at the start of the season whether with three games to go you'd be two points clear at third position I would have snapped their hand off and said 'I'll take that'.""
He also remains upbeat in the event of going away to either Leinster or Munster in the last four.
""I think there are going to be a few more little permutations that are going to happen between now and then,"" the Australian said.","Ospreys are third in the Pro12 table following a narrow 20-18 defeat by Leinster on Saturday. With three games left they seem likely to face an away trip to either Munster or Connacht in the playoffs. Currently, Munster sits in second place, while Connacht is in fourth place. Both teams have been in good form lately, making it an interesting matchup for the Ospreys. The final standings will determine the exact opponent and venue for the playoffs, but either way, the Ospreys will have a tough challenge ahead of them."
"The former deputy prime minister told the BBC takeovers ""could be very helpful"", but the UK should do more to protect its national interests.
This week, American drugs giant Pfizer announced it was bidding for British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.
The firm has 6,700 employees in the UK.
If successful, the deal would be the biggest ever takeover of a UK business by a foreign company.
Lord Heseltine, who is an adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron on economic growth, told the BBC's business editor Kamal Ahmed that ministers should have ""reserve powers"" to protect British companies when crucial interests, such as the country's science base, were at risk.
""Foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful and I have no doctrinal preoccupations - I've done enough takeovers of small businesses myself to know how valuable they can be,"" he said.
""But the important point is that every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a failsafe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers and we're the only country that doesn't.""
The proposed acquisition of AstraZeneca has prompted protests by some who feel the deal would jeopardise Britain's science and medical industries.
AstraZeneca has eight sites in the UK and about 6,700 employees.
Pfizer has said it would relocate large parts of its business to the UK, if the deal goes through. It has also suggested it wants to invest in research which could create more jobs.
But Lord Heseltine expressed his reservations over the deal.
""There are so many issues about the science base, about the supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be explored and I don't see any way in which this can be adequately done unless the government has reserve powers.
""It's a question of where their headquarters are, where the decisions are taken, who determines what research is done and where, how much government money goes into supporting the science base within a co-operative arrangement, where the supply chains are going to be and what the motive is,"" he said.
Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna, who has also criticised the proposed deal, said ministers already had powers to intervene in takeovers in certain circumstances and his party was looking at whether these should be strengthened as party of its pre-election policy review.
Some British business figures have benefited from foreign buyouts.
Michael Straughan, a board member for manufacturing at Bentley Motors, which was bought by Volkswagen Group at the turn of the century, says the company grew as a result of the takeover.
""Volkswagen has invested millions and millions of pounds in new models and infrastructure here at the site in Crewe,"" he told the BBC.
""The benefit of being owned by such a big company like Volkswagen is the use of technologies from group, which as a very small brand we could never afford on our own.""
Earlier this week, French president Francois Hollande summoned the boss of General Electric to the Elysee Palace, after the company announced its interest in buying Alstom - makers of the iconic TGV trains and one of France's biggest private sector employers.
The country's economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, said the government wanted ""to make sure that French companies... do not become prey.""
The French government is famously protective of its national companies. Back in 2005, an attempt by Pepsico to buy France's Danone was blocked by the government, who claimed it was a strategically important company.
Last year, Yahoo abandoned a bid to buy French online video site Dailymotion, following objections from government officials.
In stark contrast, the UK is the ""most open market on earth"" for foreigners to come and buy businesses, venture capitalist Jon Moulton told the BBC.
While highlighting the many benefits, including more readily-available capital, competitive pressure on companies, and a better deal for shareholders, Mr Moulton says ""people who are buying from overseas are undoubtedly biased towards their own bases"".
""It's not likely that somebody who's running a Chinese manufacturing plant will have much empathy for how a UK plant should be run.""","The former deputy prime minister told the BBC takeovers ""could be very helpful"", but the UK should do more to protect its national interests. This week, American drugs giant Pfizer announced its interest in acquiring UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The former deputy prime minister's statement reflects his belief that takeovers can bring benefits to the UK, such as investment and job creation. However, he also emphasizes the need for the UK to protect its national interests in these types of transactions.

Pfizer's interest in AstraZeneca has raised concerns about the potential impact on jobs and research in the UK pharmaceutical industry. Critics argue that Pfizer's track record in previous takeovers raises doubts about its commitment to maintaining and investing in UK operations.

The UK government has also expressed concerns about the potential loss of expertise and research capabilities to overseas investors. The former deputy prime minister's comments suggest that more should be done to safeguard national interests in such transactions, potentially through increased government intervention or regulation.

Overall, the former deputy prime minister's remarks highlight the importance of balancing the benefits and risks of takeovers for the UK, ensuring that national interests are protected while still allowing for foreign investment and growth."

Sir Elton appointed Taylor as Watford manager in 1977, a year after the singer took ownership of the club.
Within five years, Taylor took the Hornets from the old Fourth Division to runners-up in the top flight, going on to reach the 1984 FA Cup final.
""We will cherish Graham and drown our sorrows in the brilliant memories he gave us,"" Sir Elton wrote on Instagram.

Taylor, who managed England between 1990 and 1993, died on Thursday morning following a suspected heart attack, his family said.
He was a highly successful club manager who also worked at Lincoln, Wolves and Aston Villa, guiding the latter to second place in the First Division in 1990.
After resigning as England boss in 1993 following the team's failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, he managed Watford for a further five years, between 1996 and 2001.
He retired from football in 2003, later becoming a respected BBC pundit.
Sir Elton sold his stake in Watford in 1987, the year Taylor left for Villa, but he returned again as chairman in 1997.
""I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear about Graham's passing. He was like a brother to me,"" he added.

They will also organise additional tributes, involving officials and supporters from the club.
The club say they are ""inviting supporters to tweet their tributes to the club's most successful manager by using the hashtag #thankyouGT"".
The EFL said a minute's applause will be held before this weekend's fixtures, while clubs will have the option of wearing black armbands.
Football Association chairman Greg Clarke described Taylor as ""a hugely popular and respected figure in the game"".
He added: ""He had an exceptional knowledge and a love for the game that never diminished over the years. He will be much missed by us all at Wembley and St George's Park.""
Match of the Day host and former England international Gary Lineker said Taylor was ""an outstanding manager, lover of football and thoroughly decent man"".
He added: ""He made me his England captain and I will be eternally grateful to him for giving me that honour.""
Former England striker Alan Shearer, who made his international debut under Taylor in 1992, said he was ""completely shocked"" by the news of Taylor's death, adding he ""held him in the very highest regard"".
Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore said: ""You will struggle to find a more decent individual in football, one who cared passionately about all levels and aspects of the English game.""
Howard Wilkinson, chairman of the League Managers' Association - of which Taylor was the first president, paid tribute to his ""lifelong friend"".

Professional Footballers' Association chairman Gordon Taylor said he had known Graham Taylor since they were both aged 15 at England schoolboy trials.

The team's success continued as they achieved a highly respectable second place finish in their debut season in the top flight. Taylor's managerial prowess and the team's performances gained them widespread admiration and recognition.

Under Taylor's guidance, Watford also enjoyed a memorable cup run in the 1983-84 season. They reached the final of the FA Cup, facing Everton, but unfortunately lost 2-0. Despite this, their achievement of reaching the final was considered an incredible feat for a club of Watford's size and resources.

He left behind a strong foundation and a legacy that would continue to inspire the club in the years to come.

Taylor would go on to have a successful managerial career, managing clubs like Aston Villa and England's national team.

"The figures are being sent to 137 hospital trusts by Lord Carter, who has been appointed by the government to improve efficiency in the NHS.
He will spend the next six weeks meeting hospital bosses to discuss the targets, before they are made public.
In June, Lord Carter's report on the NHS identified a number of measures it said could save £5bn a year by 2019-20.
Lord Carter came to that figure after spending a year working with 22 hospitals.
He found a wide variation in spending across medicines, everyday items, such as dressings and syringes, and on facilities such as heating.
His review also said major savings could be made through better staff rotas and management of training and annual leave.
There were also wide differences in the cost of common operations, such as hip replacements, and infection rates.
He has now broken down the savings by speciality. The process has enabled Lord Carter to benchmark what each hospital should be doing in each department.
The biggest savings were identified in general medicine, followed by obstetrics and gynaecology.
The Labour peer also said hospitals should build their own care homes to look after elderly patients after they have been treated to make it easier to discharge patients.

Lord Patrick Carter, a Labour peer as it happens, is advising Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt on how hospital budgets can be better spent.
In a nutshell, Lord Carter believes that just as there is variation in levels of care around the NHS, as identified by the Care Quality Commission, there are also variations in the use of money by hospitals - some are doing it well and providing good value for the taxpayer, some are not.
He is a firm believer in good leadership leading to high-quality patient care and the most efficient use of resources.
If hospitals all adopted the best practice for different surgical procedures and treatments, he argues, then outcomes for patients would be better and money would be saved.

Prof Tim Briggs, a leading orthopaedic surgeon, has led efforts to standardise his own surgical speciality and will now help hospitals identify the most effective products and techniques across other surgical fields.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that improving quality of care and reducing post-operative complications could bring savings of about a billion pounds a year.
""If you look at the other side too - which is procurement - we've got to get our costs down"", he added.
""Everybody says, 'We've got the best deal,' when they clearly haven't.""
It comes at a time of mounting pressure on NHS finances. In the first three months of this financial year, a deficit of nearly £1bn has already built up - more than the overspend for the whole of last year.
Lord Carter said: ""The route to better care is to empower NHS leaders, so giving them the data and support they need means they can improve how they care for patients and make savings which can be reinvested in front-line care.
""Patients will be the real winners.""
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt added: ""We are giving the service £10bn extra this Parliament so it is vital to use that money to secure the best outcomes.""
But Jennifer Dixon, head of the Health Foundation think tank, said: ""The complexity of the task at hand cannot be underestimated. Staff are working flat out and need space and support to achieve change.""

Gunner James Motherwell of the 51st Division Ammunition Column, Royal Field Artillery, 51st Highland Division, died on 18 October, 1916, aged 32.
He is thought to have most likely died after coming home with injuries or illness sustained during his time fighting in the war effort.

However, due to the passage of time and weathering, some headstones had fallen into a state of disrepair. To ensure the continued respect and dignity of those who made the ultimate sacrifice, the decision was made to remove and replace these deteriorating headstones.

"The European Commission said its new mortgages directive would prevent any repeat of reckless home loan lending of the past.
The agreement also includes plans to make it easier for consumers to shop around for their loan.
A lenders' group said the changes would have little impact on the UK system.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that UK rules, which were bolstered recently, already had the greater consumer protection and information in place.
The directive, driven by the Irish Republic's presidency of the EU, aims to halt cases of mortgages being handed out without any background checks on borrowers.
The key feature is that any borrower across the 27 EU member states would be refused a home loan if they failed a standard credit worthiness assessment.
Other features of the agreement include:
""The financial crisis started with the subprime debacle in the United States where mortgages were being handed out with no background checks carried out on whether consumers could afford them, and ill-informed and often vulnerable consumers were encouraged to take excessive risk,"" said EU Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier.
""We have seen similar excesses in Europe, for example with the housing booms and the inevitable busts which followed in Spain and Ireland.""
He said the consequences had been enormous, with many people losing their homes to repossession.
""This directive will help put an end to these excesses and foster responsible lending practices,"" he added.
""Consumers will finally get the protection they deserve. They will be better informed so they can choose the mortgage product which best meets their needs, at the best price, and fully aware of the risks they are taking.""
In the UK, lenders have recently gone through a mortgage market review that tightened rules on applications. This has led to new rules, including affordability checks, which will come into force in April 2014.
Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said that the changes would create more paperwork for lenders and regulators in the UK.
But he said that little would change for mortgage applicants above the April rules.
""For consumers, the requirements of the directive add little to the consumer protection and information that UK customers already receive, since our regulatory regime is already the most advanced among European member states,"" he said.
""For customers in some other member states, the changes will result in increased protection and greater consistency.""
The European rules must be approved by the EU Parliament as a whole and endorsed by member states. A vote will be held in the EU Parliament on 11 June.","The European Commission said its new mortgages directive would prevent any repeat of reckless home loan lending of the past. The agreement also includes plans to make it easier for consumers to switch mortgage providers and compare mortgage offers across different lenders. The directive aims to enhance consumer protection, increase transparency, and promote competition in the mortgage market.

Under the new directive, lenders will be required to provide borrowers with clear and standardized information about the terms and conditions of the mortgage, including the total cost, interest rates, and any fees or charges involved. This will enable consumers to make better-informed decisions when choosing a mortgage.

Additionally, borrowers will have the right to switch their mortgage to another lender without facing excessive charges or obstacles. This will encourage competition among lenders and give consumers more options to find better deals and potentially save money.

The new rules also aim to prevent borrowers from taking on loans that they cannot afford to repay. Lenders will be required to assess the borrower's creditworthiness before granting a mortgage and ensure that the loan is affordable based on their income and financial situation.

The European Commission believes that these measures will prevent the repeat of reckless lending practices that contributed to the financial crisis in the past. By promoting responsible lending and empowering consumers, the directive aims to create a more stable and competitive mortgage market in Europe."

It is the blue-riband race of the most prestigious meeting in the sport - but only once has a female jockey ridden in it, and that was more than a generation ago.
Back in 1984, Linda Sheedy did not reach the finish on board 500-1 outsider Foxbury, so Devon-based Lizzie Kelly is determined to smash through another glass ceiling.
Not that she goes along with the idea that women have it tougher in the saddle than their male counterparts.
""A lot of the time I don't think girls push themselves to the extent that I was willing to push myself,"" she told BBC Points West.
""I wanted to dress like a male jockey, with all the right gear and everything, and you've got to really strive to achieve just as much as they are.
""I had to do more to fit in, and look right, look the same as all the lads.""
The 23-year-old rides Tea For Two in the big race on Friday and while she is comfortable with being viewed as a trailblazer in sport, it certainly is not something the conditional jockey burdens herself with.
""If anything I do is good for women in racing or women in sport, I always think that's a good thing, but it's a total by-product,"" added Kelly, who has been part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at the festival.
""I'm selfish, I'm doing it for me, I'm not doing it for females in general - I'm doing it because this is what I've worked towards and dreamed about since I was a kid.
""It's great if people look at me and think 'I can do better than her' - go on then, come on, let's do it, because why not?""
Such a comment is typical of Kelly's go-getter personality - and she has already made racing history, by guiding Tea for Two to victory in the Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton in December 2015 to become the first female jockey to win a Grade One jumps race in Britain.
""When I left university I just thought, I don't want to sit in an office from now until retirement,"" she said.
""I was 21, and I just felt that I could sit in an office for 20 years in 20 years time, and that was the push.
""I thought you have to take your chances while they're still there, and I'd have regretted not giving it a go in later life if I hadn't.""
Aside from the overriding gender theme, which Kelly accepts as a big talking point ahead of race day, it is a family team that surrounds Tea For Two.
The eight-year-old is trained by her stepfather Nick Williams in the village of George Nympton, near Barnstaple, and co-owned by mother Jane Williams, who says her daughter wasted no time getting into the saddle.
""She was so young that she was riding in the arena, they had letters on each corner of the arena, and she didn't actually know what the letters were, she was that young she couldn't read,"" said Jane.
""She hasn't been given anything - she rides for us and we run a business, and if we don't get the success then we won't be here in years to come.
""It's not a gift, she's earned it and I feel very proud that somebody can be that dedicated that they actually make it work.""
Described as being ""a jockey for the big occasion"" by her step-dad, Jane says she is more worried about her horse's mentality on the day than that of her jockey.
""The horse is exceptionally temperamental - he likes going to Exeter, but I'm not sure he particularly likes going to Cheltenham,"" she added.
""We've got to get there - it is a concern because he will have a lot of stage fright that day I suspect, because the festival is completely different to any other race meeting.""
Though Kelly and her family are proud to be making history at Cheltenham, they are looking to do far more than just make up the numbers.
Tea For Two is a 66-1 chance with most bookmakers - but Jane Williams is surprised that the odds are so long and is targeting a place.
""First of all we've got to get round, just jump round - if I came fifth or sixth I'd be absolutely over the moon.""
The final word goes to Lizzie herself; how will she feel waking up on Friday morning?
""You think I'm going to sleep?"" she responds.
""It's our first Gold Cup, it's his [Tea For Two's] first Gold Cup, my first Gold Cup, mum's first Gold Cup - so I think the only way I can try to feel is excited.""
Interviews by Damian Derrick, BBC Points West","Media playback is not supported on this device It is the blue-riband race of the most prestigious meeting in the sport - but only once has a female jockey ridden to victory in the Grand National. The Grand National is a famous horse racing event held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England.

In 2021, Rachael Blackmore made history by becoming the first female jockey to win the Grand National. She rode a horse named Minella Times to victory in a thrilling race. Blackmore's achievement was widely celebrated and hailed as a significant breakthrough for women in the sport.

The Grand National is known for its challenging course and large field of competitors. The race is watched by millions of people worldwide, making it one of the most-watched and popular horse racing events.

Despite the historic win by Rachael Blackmore, female jockeys still face underrepresentation in high-profile horse racing events. However, with breakthroughs like Blackmore's victory in the Grand National, the sport is gradually becoming more inclusive and diverse, encouraging more opportunities for female jockeys to showcase their skills."
"Nigeria narrowly beat hosts Senegal 1-0 in the first semi-final of the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations to earn a place in Saturday's final.
Captain Peter Etebo scored the key goal from the penalty spot.
Algeria beat South Africa 2-0 in the second semi after goals from Oussama Darfalou and Mohamed Benkhemassa.
Senegal and South Africa face a crucial third-place match on Saturday, with the winners also earning a place in Brazil.
Just before half-time in a tense match, Nigeria keeper Emmanuel Daniel was both villain and hero.
First he conceded a penalty for a foul on Cheikhou Dieng but he then saved a poor effort from the spot by Ibrahima Sory Keita.
With both sides struggling to find the target, Nigeria coach Samson Siasia brought on the top scorer from the recent Under-17 World Cup, Victor Osimhen.
The match changed in the 75th minute when Nigeria were awarded a penalty after Senegal's Ousseynou Thioune, who was sent off, handled the ball as he collided with his goalkeeper Pape N'Diaye Souare.
Etebo stepped up to do what Keita was unable to do earlier and net an emphatic effort that Souare had little chance of saving.
Senegal's 10 men pushed for the equaliser that would have taken the game to penalties but even with five minutes of injury time left, they were unable to break down the stubborn Nigerian defence.
In the other game, South Africa conceded an early goal against an Algerian side who threatened regularly with their slick counter-attacking.
Darfalou sped unopposed on to a hopeful long pass from captain Riyad Keniche after nine minutes and lobbed the ball over South Africa goalkeeper Jody February.
South Africa fluffed a rare chance to level when Gift Motupa's control let him down.
Algeria knew a second goal would kill off the game and it arrived five minutes after half-time when Benkhemassa rifled a weak clearance into the corner.","Nigeria narrowly beat hosts Senegal 1-0 in the first semi-final of the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations to earn a place in Saturday's final. Captain Peter Etebo scored the key goal for Nigeria in the 78th minute of the match. The game was evenly contested, with both teams creating several opportunities, but it was Etebo's well-placed shot from inside the penalty area that ultimately proved to be the difference.

Nigeria's victory means they have secured their spot in the final of the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations and are now just one win away from qualifying for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They will face the winner of the second semi-final between South Africa and Egypt in the final.

The match was held at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, Senegal, and the atmosphere was electric as the home crowd rallied behind their team. However, Nigeria's disciplined defense and clinical finishing ensured that they came out on top.

Both teams showed great determination throughout the match, but Nigeria's ability to hold on to their lead in the closing stages sealed the victory for them. Senegal pushed hard for an equalizer but were unable to find the back of the net.

The win marks a significant achievement for Nigeria, who finished as runners-up in the previous edition of the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations. They will now be looking to go one better and lift the trophy in the final.

Overall, the match was a tightly contested affair between two talented teams, with Nigeria's Peter Etebo's goal proving decisive. The victory puts Nigeria one step closer to their goal of qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics and sets up an exciting final for fans to look forward to."

"The suspects were shot dead in the eastern town of Verviers after they opened fire on police with automatic weapons on Thursday evening.
Officials say they had returned from Syria and planned imminent attacks on police targets. Another suspect was wounded before being arrested.
Searches were also carried out overnight in the Brussels area.
Speaking after Thursday's raid in Verviers, near the German border, Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said the terror threat level had been raised to three - the second highest.
Referring to the raid itself, he said: ""The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised.""
After the operation, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area.
Police are expected to provide more details at a briefing on Friday.
""Operations on the ground are now over. We are now exploiting the information [from the overnight anti-terror operations],"" Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told French TV station iTele.
Some Jewish schools in Antwerp and Brussels were closed on Friday, after they were informed that they could be potential targets, Belgian newspaper Joods Actueel reported.
Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in the capital Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek.
Earlier that day, two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, Belgian media reported.
Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq.
The country is thought to have the highest number of foreign fighters per capita in Europe who have taken part in fighting in Syria.
Prosecutors said the suspects in Verviers were believed to have been plotting to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties.
Eyewitnesses reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions.
Marylou Fletcher, one of the witnesses, told the BBC: ""We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots.
""My children cried. They are just terrified.""
The area around the train station remains sealed off.
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said the security operation ""shows the government's determination to fight those who want to spread terror"", his spokesman said.
Verviers is in the province of Liege, close to the German border, and has a population of about 56,000.
The incident comes a week after attacks in neighbouring France that killed 17 people. Belgian media has reported that some of the weapons used in those attacks were bought in Brussels.
However, Mr Van Der Sypt said no weapons link with the killings in France had been established.
The suspects in the Belgium raids had been under surveillance for some time - well before last week's traumatic events in Paris, the BBC's Chris Morris in Verviers says.
But there are fears that the suspects captured or killed in this operation could have been inspired by the killings in France to accelerate their own plans, our correspondent adds.
The attacks in and around Paris - on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher market and police - have heightened security fears in several European countries.
In May last year, four people were killed inside the Jewish museum in Brussels. A Frenchman of Algerian descent is in custody in Belgium over the attack.","The suspects were shot dead in the eastern town of Verviers after they opened fire on police with automatic weapons on Thursday evening. Officials say they had returned from Syria and were planning an imminent terrorist attack in Belgium. The two suspects, identified as Belgian nationals, were also believed to have connections to other extremist groups in Europe.

The operation in Verviers was part of a larger crackdown by Belgian authorities on individuals who had traveled to Syria to join terrorist organizations such as ISIS. The suspects were under surveillance when they were confronted by police, leading to a fierce firefight.

According to officials, the suspects were heavily armed and had a large stockpile of weapons and explosives in their hideout. The quick and decisive action by the police prevented what could have been a significant terrorist attack.

The incident in Verviers highlighted the ongoing threat posed by individuals who return from conflict zones, radicalized and trained in combat. European countries have been grappling with the issue of foreign fighters, as many citizens have joined extremist groups in Syria and Iraq and are now returning home.

The incident also raised concerns about the presence of radicalized cells and sleeper cells within Europe. Security agencies across the continent have been working together to identify and neutralize such threats, but this incident served as a reminder of the challenges they face.

Since the Verviers incident, Belgian authorities have increased security measures and conducted several raids across the country to ensure the safety of its citizens. The European Union has also pledged to enhance cooperation and intelligence sharing among member states to combat the threat of terrorism.

The shooting in Verviers served as a stark reminder of the need for ongoing vigilance and proactive measures to prevent terrorist attacks. The battle against extremism and radicalization continues as societies work to protect themselves from the dangers posed by such individuals and groups."

"Many gamers have showcased a modification to video game Grand Theft Auto V, in which sticky bombs were switched with exploding Samsung phones.
But some have reported that their videos have been blocked on YouTube following a copyright complaint.
Samsung has not yet responded to repeated BBC requests for comment.
Critics have warned that trying to remove gamers' videos will only draw more attention to them.
The Galaxy Note 7 was recalled and discontinued in October after reports that some handsets were catching fire.
One US gamer - known as DoctorGTA - said restrictions had been put on his YouTube account as a result of Samsung's complaint.
""It's going to take three months to get the strike removed from my channel... I got my live stream taken away,"" he said in a video.
""If I submit a counter-notification to say 'sue me', I wonder what they will do. Will they sue me, the kid that has cancer and just makes money off YouTube playing a video game?""

Some viewers warned that Samsung was at risk of invoking the Streisand Effect - a term used to denotes increased publicity as a result of attempts to remove embarrassing online content.
It was first used in 2005 by Mike Masnick, founder of the website Techdirt, following a failed attempt by singer Barbra Streisand to sue a photographer who posted a picture of her seaside home.
The original download page for the Grand Theft Auto V modification, created by player HitmanNiko, has not been taken offline.","Many gamers have showcased a modification to video game Grand Theft Auto V, in which sticky bombs were switched with exploding Samsung phones. But some have reported that their videos were flagged or removed by YouTube for violating its terms of service. This raises questions about the censorship of such content and the potential influence of corporations like Samsung in these matters.

YouTube has a set of guidelines and policies that content creators must adhere to, and any violation can result in videos being flagged, demonetized, or even removed. While it is unclear exactly why videos featuring this modification were flagged or removed, it is possible that it violated YouTube's guidelines in some way.

One potential reason could be that the content depicted violence or harm using a real-life brand, Samsung, which may have led to copyright concerns or negative brand association. YouTube may have deemed this to be inappropriate or potentially harmful to Samsung's reputation.

This situation raises broader concerns about potential corporate influence on content censorship. If corporations can influence the removal or restriction of content that showcases their products in a negative light, it can be seen as a form of censorship. Critics argue that this can suppress creativity and limit the freedom of expression of content creators.

On the other hand, YouTube's guidelines aim to ensure that content is respectful, safe, and within legal boundaries. Brand associations and copyright issues can be sensitive matters, and platforms like YouTube must balance the interests of creators, viewers, and corporations.

Ultimately, the removal or flagging of videos featuring the Samsung phone mod in Grand Theft Auto V highlights the ongoing debate surrounding content censorship,"
"The claim: 1.7 million pensioners are living in poverty and a million in fuel poverty.
Reality Check verdict: The figure for pensioners who are defined as living in poverty in the UK is a bit higher than that at 1.9 million. There isn't a specific figure for the number of pensioners in fuel poverty in the UK but a million is not an unreasonable estimate based on the figures that we do have.
The Conservatives have not given any details of how they would apply a means test or how much they would hope to save.
The winter fuel payment is between £100 and £300 (depending on your circumstances) paid to anyone receiving a state pension or people of pension age receiving certain other social security benefits.
In winter 2015-16 it was paid to 12.2 million people, 42,000 of whom lived elsewhere in Europe.
Kuenssberg: Labour cry foul over lack of Tory costings
Pensioner heating curbs 'sick and sneaky'
Mr McDonnell pointed out that since we don't know where the means test will fall, a number of less well-off pensioners could still lose the benefit.
He suggested it might just be people entitled to pension credit who would get the fuel allowance, although government sources have told the BBC that would not be the mechanism, and that there would be a consultation process to decide how it would be tested.
Pensioners with an income below £159.35 a week may claim pension credit - it's £243.45 for couples.
According to the latest figures from November  there were 1.9 million people claiming pension credit, or 2.2 million if you include their partners, although there has been research suggesting that about one-third of people entitled to it are not claiming.
Mr McDonnell told the BBC that there were 1.7 million pensioners living in poverty and a million living in fuel poverty.
People count as living in relative poverty if they are in households with an income below 60% of the median household income. The median income is the one for which half of households have higher incomes and half have lower.
The government's preferred measure of pensioner poverty is after housing costs have been taken into account. Nearly three-quarters of pensioners live in homes that are owned outright (compared with roughly one in five of the working-age population) and so are less likely to have high housing costs.
On that measure, 16% of UK pensioners are in poverty, which is 1.9 million people.
There are also measures of absolute poverty, which may measure whether people are able to afford a basic lifestyle - about 8% of pensioners fall below the threshold for material deprivation.
To measure fuel poverty, the government looks at two things - how much you have to pay for fuel, and what your income is. You'll be considered to be in fuel poverty if your required fuel costs are above average and, were you to spend that amount, your remaining income would leave you below the official poverty line as explained above.
The latest government figures we have on fuel poverty relate to 2014 and suggest 2.38 million households in total in England were in fuel poverty.
There isn't a specific figure for the number of UK pensioners in fuel poverty, but according to Table 14 there were 621,000 households just in England in 2014 in which the oldest member was over 60. Age UK says this equates to more than 1 million individuals, although some of them will not yet be entitled to their state pension.

Follow us on Twitter","The claim: 1.7 million pensioners are living in poverty and a million in fuel poverty. Reality Check verdict: The figure for pensioners who are defined as living in poverty in the UK varies depending on the definition used. However, according to the Office for National Statistics, in 2019/2020, around 1.6 million pensioners were living in relative poverty before housing costs (meaning their income falls below 60% of the median income), and 2.0 million were living in relative poverty after housing costs. 

Regarding fuel poverty, which is defined as spending more than 10% of household income on fuel to maintain a warm and healthy home, it is estimated that around 2.4 million households in the UK were in fuel poverty in 2018, but this figure includes both pensioner and non-pensioner households. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that a million pensioners are specifically in fuel poverty. 

It is important to note that poverty and fuel poverty are complex issues affected by various factors, including household income, housing costs, and energy prices. The numbers can vary depending on the definitions and data sources used."

When they started to do a police check on the men one made off on foot, with the horses in pursuit.
Horses, Rubin and Bodie, caught up with the suspect who was wanted after being recalled to prison.

"Governments have agreed to keep the global temperature rise to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and preferably 1.5 degrees.

The Eiffel Tower in Paris is expected to be lit up in green light on Friday to mark the entry into force of the historic climate pact.
Delegates from almost 200 countries are meeting in Marrakech next week to consider the way ahead beyond Paris.
The deal agreed in the French capital less than a year ago commits governments to moving their economies away from fossil fuels.
On Thursday, a UN review of national pledges to cut carbon said they fall short of the levels needed to keep the rise in global temperatures under 2C.
The report found pledges from governments that have ratified the accord would see the world on track for a rise in temperatures by the end of this century of between 2.9 and 3.4 degrees C.
Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst
The Paris climate pact comes into force less than a year since it was agreed. The last major climate deal - the Kyoto Protocol - took eight years to come into force. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. However, the national targets for cutting carbon emissions are voluntary. The UN tried a mandatory approach but countries that were failing to meet their targets simply quit.
The process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate. Governments that rushed to enshrine Paris in law have had one eye on the US elections. Hilary Clinton has pledged to take President Obama's emissions cuts further. Donald Trump wants to tear up the agreement.
Environmental groups and other experts have urged governments to do more.
World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said even with the commitments made in Paris and encouraging action on the ground, ""we will not meet our aspiration of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees unless we move faster and at the scale that is needed"".
""As the world heads into (the meeting) in Marrakesh, we must regain the sense of urgency we felt a year ago,"" he said.
In Marrakech governments and parties will work on details of a ""rulebook"" which will measure and review global climate action.
What was agreed in Paris?
•         To peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century
•         To keep global temperature increase ""well below"" 2C (3.6F) and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C
•         To review progress every five years
•         $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2020, with a commitment to further finance in the future.
Donald Trump has called manmade climate change ""a hoax"" and said he would ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. He says he supports clean water and air, but wants to slash funding to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.
Hillary Clinton backs the Paris deal, saying climate change is a threat to American security. She supports stringent regulation of the energy industry and opposes expanded drilling in Alaska, but has not made the environment a central part of her campaign.

""This is a moment to celebrate,"" United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa said after the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015. The agreement was hailed as a historic achievement in the fight against climate change.

However, keeping global temperature increase within these limits requires significant efforts from all countries. It involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources, and implementing climate adaptation measures. Achieving these goals is a considerable challenge that requires sustained commitment and cooperation from governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide.

To monitor progress and hold countries accountable, the Paris Agreement established a framework for transparency and regular reporting. Each country is required to submit their emissions reduction targets and progress reports periodically. These reports are reviewed collectively to assess global progress towards the temperature goals.

While the Paris Agreement is an essential step towards tackling climate change, there are ongoing debates about its effectiveness and the need for more ambitious action. Some argue that the agreed temperature targets are insufficient to avoid catastrophic consequences, urging nations to aim for more significant reductions. Others emphasize that even meeting these goals requires immense efforts, and focusing on them is already a significant challenge.

Ultimately, addressing climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires sustained commitment and collaboration on a global scale. Although the Paris Agreement provides a framework for action, it requires continued efforts and adjustments to achieve its objectives."
"The Hammers will pay £2.5m rent annually but will not have to fund police, stewarding, heating, pitch maintenance, or even corner flags.
""My dog could have negotiated a better deal for the taxpayer,"" said Hearn.
West Ham said it was ""a great deal"" for the club and the public.
The Premier League club move to the 60,000-seater stadium from the Boleyn Ground, which has a 35,000 capacity, at the end of this season.
Olympic Stadium bosses, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), fought a ruling that the deal should be published, but the appeal was rejected this week.
On Thursday, full details of the 207-page contract were published for the first time, including that:
West Ham have paid £15m towards the £272m costs of transforming the stadium into a football venue.
Hearn, who unsuccessfully tried to get the Hammers to groundshare with Orient at the Olympic Stadium, told BBC Sport: ""It's a hugely beneficial deal to West Ham and good luck to them.
""They've negotiated a good deal. I can't say the same for the LLDC who should go back to negotiation school.
""Frankly it was a hot potato that [London mayor] Boris Johnson and the LLDC wanted to get rid of. They wanted to close a deal at any price and they will say 'quite rightly because we didn't have anyone else'.""
The LLDC fought publication on the grounds of commercial sensitivity and fear the decision to publish will cost it million of pounds in lost revenue.
""The stadium needs to be a profitable and successful commercial operation, otherwise it will rely on public subsidy,"" said a spokesperson.
West Ham insist the club have nothing to hide and believe their position as anchor tenant helps ensure the stadium does not become a ""white elephant"".
""We were unanimously chosen as the anchor tenant, above others, including football clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient, as we offered the best deal and the only option for a true and lasting legacy,"" said a Hammers statement.
The deal was published after a lengthy legal battle following an initial freedom of information request from an alliance of 14 supporters' groups.
""This is a victory for the power of football supporters - organised, focused and willing to work together to achieve a collective goal,"" said a coalition statement.
Aside from West Ham, who will rent the venue for 25 days a year, the venue will host concerts and other sporting events, including the IAAF and IPC Athletics World Championships next year.","The Hammers will pay £2.5m rent annually but will not have to fund police, stewarding, heating, pitch maintenance, or even corner flags. ""My dog could have negotiated a better deal ,"" said one local resident. Other critics argue that this deal is unfair to taxpayers and puts too much financial burden on the local council. With all these perks given to the Hammers, many believe that they won't have much incentive to invest in the community or contribute to its development. This deal has left a sour taste in the mouths of many residents who feel like they've been taken advantage of."
"Nicole Kushner Meyer used her brother's name while promoting an investment-for-visas scheme in Beijing and Shanghai.
Critics were quick to accuse the family business of playing up its connection to the White House at the event.
But the company said on Monday the comments were misconstrued and Ms Meyer was only pointing out he left the firm.
""Ms Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,"" said Risa Heller, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman.
""Kushner Companies apologises if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms Meyer's intention.""
Mr Kushner, 36, who is married to President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and serves as a White House senior adviser, has come under scrutiny for his private business interests.
Government ethics laws bar government officials from profiting personally from their roles.
Jared Kushner: The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear
Is Kushner the most powerful 36-year-old in the world?
Ms Meyer mentioned her brother on Saturday and Sunday while urging investors to put $500,000 (Â£386,500) into a New Jersey real estate project in exchange for investor visas and residency cards in the US through the so-called EB-5 programme.
The EB-5 visa programme, often used by wealthy Chinese nationals, allows foreign investors a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs in the US.
Critics of the programme say it used as a means of cheap financing for real estate developers.
Ms Meyer brought up her brother as the company's former chief executive before he left in January to join the Trump administration.
She then said the Jersey City project, which the company is developing with real estate firm KABR group, ""means a lot to me and my entire family"", the New York Times reported.
About 15% of the $976.4m-project, known as One Journal Square, will be funded through the EB-5 programme, according to Kushner Companies.
The company also featured a photo of President Trump  on a slide at the event that said ""key decision makers"" on the EB-5 programme, CNN reported.
The White House said on Monday that it was ""evaluating wholesale reform"" on the programme to make sure it it was ""used as intended and that investment is being spread to all areas of the country"".
The administration also said it was ""exploring the possibility of raising the price of the visa to further bring the programme in line with its intent"".
Reforming visa programmes has been a key part of Mr Trump's immigration policy.
Mr Kushner has said he stepped away from his family's business operations, but government ethics filings show that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, continue to benefit from their stake in Kushner Companies.
The president's son-in-law, who has no prior government experience, has been entrusted to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and also serves as the lead adviser on relations with China, Mexico and Canada.
Blake Roberts, Mr Kushner's attorney, said on Saturday that he has divested his interests in the One Journal Square project.
""As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program,"" Mr Roberts said in a statement.","Nicole Kushner Meyer used her brother's name while promoting an investment-for-visas scheme in Beijing and Shanghai. Critics were quick to accuse the family business of playing up its connection to the White House and using it to attract investors. Nicole Kushner Meyer, sister of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was speaking at events in China where she was encouraging wealthy Chinese nationals to invest $500,000 or more in a New Jersey real estate project through the EB-5 visa program. This controversial program allows foreign investors to receive green cards if they invest a certain amount in U.S. business ventures that create jobs.

During her presentations, Kushner Meyer mentioned her brother's role in the Trump administration and even showed a slide featuring a photo of President Trump. This led to accusations that she was exploiting her family's political connections to gain financial benefits. Critics argued that this raised ethical concerns and suggested that it may violate federal conflict-of-interest rules.

The Kushner family business, Kushner Companies, later apologized for any ""reference to the White House"" during Nicole Kushner Meyer's presentations, stating that it was not their intention to connect their business to the administration. They claimed that the intention was merely to inform potential investors about the project.

This incident sparked further discussions about the potential conflicts of interest arising from family members of President Trump being involved in business activities while serving in the White House. Critics argued that it raised questions about potential influence peddling and the use of public office for personal gain.

However, the Trump administration distanced themselves from the issue, stating that Jared Kushner had divested from Kushner Companies and had no involvement in the EB-5 visa program. The administration also emphasized that Nicole Kushner Meyer was not a government employee and her actions should not reflect on the White House.

Overall, this incident added fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding conflicts of interest and nepotism in the Trump administration and highlighted concerns about the potential misuse of political connections for personal gain."
"The company said sales had increased by 30% in the four months to June.
The trading statement pushed up Asos shares 3.7%, reaching a two-year high.
Chief executive Nick Beighton said the company now expected full-year sales growth ""at the upper end of the 20-25% (guided) range,"" and was ""confident"" of hitting pre-tax profit targets.
In a conference call, he said that there would be a medium-term benefit to the company from the weaker pound.
Sterling has slumped to around $1.30 from almost $1.50 on 23 June before the vote to leave the European Union. A weaker pound enables UK based retailers to be more competitive in overseas markets.
Sales were £500.5m for the four months to June compared with £386m last year, with the number of active customers increasing by 24% to 12 million.
Sales were strong both in the UK, which posted a rise of 28% to £203m, and internationally, which rose 31% to £297m.
Asos confirmed the closure of its Chinese business, originally announced April, saying that this would enable it to invest £2m elsewhere and remove a drag on earnings.
Asos was set up in 2000 and was an early entrant into online fashion retailing, but in recent years it has faced stiff online competition from High Street retailers as well as UK and European competitors.","The company said sales had increased by 30% in the four months to June. The trading statement pushed up Asos shares 3.7%, reaching a two-year high. Chief executive Nick Beighton commented, ""We are thrilled to see such strong growth in our sales over the past four months. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, as well as the continued support of our customers. We have seen particularly strong growth in our international markets, with sales in Europe and the US driving much of our success. We remain focused on providing an exceptional online shopping experience and delivering on our commitment to sustainability. This positive momentum gives us confidence for the future and we are optimistic about the months ahead."" The increase in sales has also attracted investors, resulting in the rise of Asos shares by 3.7%, reaching a two-year high. This positive response from the market reflects growing confidence in the company's performance and future prospects."
"Asked if the MPs were thinking of defecting, Mr Farron said he did not want to ""betray confidences"".
But he told BBC News it would be ""not surprising"" if they had serious doubts about the direction Labour was taking under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
Mr Farron said he was contacted via text messages after Mr Corbyn was elected Labour leader on Saturday.
He said he had also spoken on the telephone to Labour MPs, but he declined to name names or say whether they were front bench figures.
Speaking to the Evening Standard, he said: ""I've had various unsolicited texts, some of them over the weekend, where I felt like I was being an agony aunt rather than anything else.
""People who have been members of the [Labour] party for as long as I've been a member of mine who feel that they don't recognise their party anymore and feel deeply distressed.""
Mr Farron, who was elected Lib Dem leader in July, was speaking ahead of the party's annual conference in Bournemouth, which gets under way at the weekend.
It is the party's first gathering since its crushing defeat at May's general election, when it lost all but eight of its MPs.
Mr Farron has called the election of Mr Corbyn a ""quite staggering opportunity"" for his party to occupy the centre ground in British politics, which he believes is being rapidly vacated by the New Labour leader in favour of a hard left agenda.
Quizzed about his contacts with Labour MPs on the BBC's Look North, he said: ""I am keen to be a decent sort and not betray any confidences - but it would be not surprising if Labour MPs, voters, members and indeed donors were thinking hang about this isn't the Labour Party that I voted for, I need a party that will hold the Tories to account, that can beat the Tories and which believes not just in social justice and fairness, but also in sound economics.
""Because you can't protect the health service if the economy goes down the plughole.""
Former foreign secretary Jack Straw played down the prospect of Labour MPs defecting to other parties, suggesting the experience of the SDP in the 1980s made that ""very unlikely"".
But he said the new leadership could have a ""Lazarus effect"" on the Liberal Democrats, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's The World at One.","Asked if the MPs were thinking of defecting, Mr Farron said he did not want to ""betray confidences"". But he told BBC News it would be ""not surprising"" if they were considering it. He said, ""Given the current political climate and the challenges facing the party, it is understandable that some MPs may be considering their options."" Mr Farron emphasized that the decision to defect or remain in the party was ultimately up to each individual, and he respected their autonomy to make their own choices. He further added, ""I believe in the strength of the Liberal Democrat values and believe that we can overcome this difficult period, but it is important to respect the decisions made by our colleagues."""
"Stephen Beadman, 29, had previously admitted the murder and rape of Kayleigh Haywood in Leicestershire.
The jury is yet to reach a verdict on co-defendant Luke Harlow, 28, who admitted engaging in sexual activity with the teenager, but denied a false imprisonment charge, last year.
Jurors will resume deliberations on Harlow's charge on Tuesday.
Both men, of George Avenue, Ibstock, Leicestershire, are due to be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court next week.
The jury deliberated for just under six hours to find Beadman guilty of false imprisonment.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Harlow, who is facing the same charge, has pleaded guilty to meeting Kayleigh following sexual grooming.
Her disappearance on 13 November prompted an outpouring of support from the community in her home village of Measham and the wider area.
The 15-year-old's body was found in a field outside Ibstock five days after she was last seen outside Ibstock Community College. An inquest heard she died from head and facial injuries.
Kayleigh was kept prisoner at Harlow's home between about 21:00 BST on Saturday 14 November and 03:00 on 15 November, the prosecution told the court.
She and Harlow had been exchanging messages via social media.
The unemployed former media studies student has admitted attempting to meet two other 15-year-old girls for sexual purposes and had contacted a 13-year-old too.
On the evening of Friday 13 November, Harlow and Kayleigh met for the first time. He admitted sexually touching her after she had been drinking heavily.
Earlier in the trial, he denied Beadman's barrister's suggestion Kayleigh had escaped after she awoke to find he and Beadman arguing because Harlow had allegedly attempted to rape her while she slept.
In the early hours of Sunday Kayleigh was seen leaving the flat.
A witness said she was naked from the waist down and Beadman was pinning her to the ground.
Beadman, who pleaded guilty to her rape and murder, opted not to give evidence in the trial.
He told police he could not remember what had happened because he had been drinking but later confessed to first raping the teenager, then killing her with a brick.
He told officers: ""When I drink I just switch. But when I switch I get violent.""
The jury of six men and five women at Nottingham Crown Court unanimously agreed he had kept her prisoner but could not reach a verdict on which they all agreed on Harlow.
They will resume deliberations on Tuesday.
The pair are due to appear again at the same court on Friday to be sentenced.","Stephen Beadman, 29, had previously admitted the murder and rape of Kayleigh Haywood in Leicestershire. The jury is yet to reach a verdict on co-defendant Luke Harlow, 28, who admitted to sexual activity with a child. The trial is ongoing in Nottingham Crown Court.

Kayleigh Haywood, a 15-year-old girl, went missing in November 2015 after being contacted by Beadman on social media. Her disappearance prompted a wide-scale search and received nationwide attention. Tragically, her body was found five days later by a lake in Leicestershire.

During the trial, the court heard how Beadman had lured Kayleigh to his flat, where he raped and murdered her. Harlow, who was present at the flat during the incident, admitted to engaging in sexual activity with the underage girl.

The prosecution argued that both Beadman and Harlow had acted together to exploit and abuse Kayleigh, using online grooming techniques. They claimed that the defendants took advantage of her vulnerability and manipulated her into going to Beadman's flat.

The defense has argued that Harlow was not involved in the violence or murder and only engaged in sexual activity with Kayleigh with her consent. They maintained that Harlow should not be held accountable for Beadman's actions.

The jury is now deliberating on Harlow's guilt or innocence, considering the evidence and testimonies presented during the trial. The verdict is yet to be reached.

The case has highlighted the dangers of online grooming and the importance of safeguarding young people from potential sexual exploitation. The brutal nature of Kayleigh's murder has deeply shocked and saddened the community, leaving a lasting impact on those involved."
"Barbara Wilding said there was an ""emerging"" picture of students turning to sex work, such as prostitution, erotic dancing and escort work.
A Swansea University project is trying to gauge the scale of the issue.
Ms Wilding said it was important to find out if students were forced into the work.
She added that support also needed to be put in place.
Swansea University is carrying out a three year study into concerns that students in Wales are turning to prostitution and other sex work.
It is feared some may have turned to it as a way of funding their studies.
However, there is only anecdotal evidence in Wales and the university believes an in-depth study into the issue is needed.
It has been given Â£489,143 of funding from the Big Lottery Fund to find out how big the issue is and to help provide support.
As part of its research it is launching the website - the Student Sex Work Project - on Friday, which researchers hope will prompt student sex workers to get in touch anonymously to share their views and experiences.
Ms Wilding, chair of the board of governors at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said there was much still unknown about the issue in Wales.
""This is an emerging area and this is the area we don't know very much about at all,"" she said.
""In fact what we don't know really is what the scale of it is in Wales.""
She said research from the National Union of Students and sexual health agencies suggested that the problem was growing.
She pointed to studies in England, including one from the English Collective of Prostitutes which said calls to its helpline from students had doubled in 12 months.
""We need to know whether we have got the appropriate response to it and what's the motivation and can we do something about that as well, because it can be a very vulnerable area of activity for anyone to get involved in,"" she added.
Ms Wilding, who stood down as chief constable in 2009, said during her time as a police officer working on the streets in London in the 1970s she had often come into contact with women who were prostitutes and sex workers.
""This isn't a new game,"" she said.
""But they were mainly people who had drug addiction or had mental health problems or in really desperate desperate financial situations. They were often driven into it with no choice.
""Whereas with students we think we are dealing with a different set of circumstances.
""They are intelligent, starting their lives.""
She admitted she was ""surprised"" when she was told about the evidence in her role as committee member at the Big Lottery Fund Wales.
She said she had asked staff at Cardiff Metropolitan University if they knew anything about the problem.
""Recently the chaplain there has become aware of men and women becoming involved in sex work,"" she added.
She added it was important to find out whether students were choosing to take part in sex work or whether they were being forced into it.
Dr Tracey Sagar, a lecturer at the university's Centre for Criminal Justice and Criminology who specialises in the regulation of sex work and is leading the project, said she hoped the research would ""ensure that the right policies and services are in place for young people who engage in the sex markets in Wales"".
Hannah Pudner, director of NUS Wales, said the research was ""more important now than ever"".
""We are coming across more and more stories of female students turning to the sex industry to fund their studies,"" she added.
Visitors to the website can also access comprehensive sexual health and personal safety advice.","Barbara Wilding said there was an ""emerging"" picture of students turning to sex work, such as prostitution, erotic dancing and escort work.

The project aims to gather data through surveys and interviews with current and former students involved in the sex industry, as well as engaging with relevant support services. By examining the experiences and motivations of these individuals, the research hopes to provide insight into the complex issues surrounding student involvement in sex work and inform the development of appropriate support mechanisms. The project also aims to challenge stigmatizing attitudes towards sex work and promote informed discussions around the topic."
"The 23-year-old had a host of clubs chasing his signature five years ago.
""I had a choice of a few,"" Hardaker said. ""Warrington wanted to sign me, Wigan had words about me, Hull FC and then Leeds came in for me.
""They (Leeds) were one of the last clubs to come in, but once I heard they wanted me, I jumped at the chance.""
Hardaker is aiming to help Leeds to the Grand Slam this weekend as the Rhinos face Wigan in the Grand Final at Old Trafford.
Leeds secured the League Leaders' Shield last month having already thumped Hull KR 50-0 to win the Challenge Cup in August.
The full-back said he could not believe the interest the bigger clubs showed after Featherstone agreed he could take the step up from part-time rugby.
He added: ""My agent had a little chat with Wigan. The teams that came in for me at the time I just thought 'wow, why are they interested in a lad from Fev?'
""Fev played a massive part. The relationship between (chairman) Mark Campbell and (Leeds chief executive) Gary Hetherington was special and they wanted my career to kick on and not for me to disappear.
""They knew I had something special to offer. They both talked about it and, looking back, when I thought Leeds was the right choice, doing the things I've done has proved that decision to be right.""","The 23-year-old had a host of clubs chasing his signature five years ago. ""I had a choice of a few,"" Hardaker said. ""Warrington wanted to sign me, Wigan had words with my agent, and Leeds were also interested. In the end, I chose to stay at Leeds because I felt like it was the best decision for my career at that point.""

Hardaker's decision to stay at Leeds proved to be a wise one, as he went on to have a successful spell with the club. He helped them win the Super League title in 2015 and was named the Man of Steel that same year.

However, Hardaker's time at Leeds eventually came to an end in 2017, when he was suspended by the club for a doping violation. He subsequently signed with Castleford Tigers, where he has since redeemed himself and become one of the team's key players.

Reflecting on his decision to stay at Leeds, Hardaker said, ""I think it was the right move for me at the time. Leeds is a great club with a lot of history, and I felt like I could continue to grow and develop as a player there.""

He also admitted that it was a tough decision to make, with the other clubs offering him enticing opportunities. ""It was flattering to have so many clubs interested in signing me. But ultimately, I had to consider what was best for my career and where I saw myself progressing the most.""

"Boyle told the Radio Times the refusal left he and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce ""in grief"".
He wanted his film about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to ""fill the space in my heart left by the abandoned Bowie script"", he added.
Boyle said Bowie's decision made him determined to get the Jobs film made.
The new film, with a screenplay by The West Wing's Aaron Sorkin, stars Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet, has been tipped for Oscars success.
Meanwhile, Boyle is set to revisit his 1996 breakthrough cult hit Trainspotting, and he is hoping that the second instalment will coincide with the film's 20th anniversary next year.
He told the Radio Times: ""It's not called Porno!"", in reference to the Irvine Welsh novel of the same name, on which it is loosely based.
""It's T2 for now. We've got a window for the original cast to shoot in spring 2016 and hopefully it will come out the same year, on the anniversary.""","Boyle told the Radio Times the refusal left he and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce ""in grief"". He wanted his film about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to ""fill the space in our hearts left by his passing"". Boyle explained that he and Boyce had worked closely on the script and were eager to bring Jobs' story to life on screen, capturing the essence of his genius and impact on the world.

The director expressed his disappointment, as he believed the film could have been a respectful and powerful tribute to Jobs' life and work. He also mentioned that they had conducted extensive research and interviews with people who knew Jobs personally, in order to gather a comprehensive understanding of the man behind the Apple empire.

Boyle added that Jobs was a complex individual, with both admirable qualities and flaws, and that their film would have aimed to portray him as a human being rather than an untouchable figure. He hoped that the audience would have been able to connect with Jobs on a deeper level, beyond his achievements in the technology industry.

"Mr Bannon, formerly the head of the populist right-wing, Breitbart News website, will join high-level discussions about national security.
The order was signed on Saturday.
The director of national intelligence and the joint chiefs will attend when discussions pertain to their areas.
Under previous administrations, the director and joint chiefs attended all meetings of the NSC's inner circle, the principals' committee.
The National Security Council (NSC) is the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.
It is led by retired lieutenant-general Mike Flynn, who was one of Mr Trump's closest advisers and most ardent supporters during the campaign.
""The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries,"" Mr Trump's executive order said.
""Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative.""
Last week, Mr Bannon described the US mainstream media as ""the opposition party"", saying it should ""keep its mouth shut"".
The site he once managed, Breitbart News, serves up an anti-establishment agenda that critics accuse of xenophobia and misogyny. Under Mr Bannon, it became one of the most-read conservative news and opinion sites in the US.
Mr Trump also ordered a restructuring of the Homeland Security Council.
In two separate measures, the president ordered:","Mr Bannon, formerly the head of the populist right-wing, Breitbart News website, will join high-level discussions about national security.

But the Royal Navy has always denied any involvement and has been cleared.
Campaigners believe a debate could reveal what happened.
A petition has been started in a bid to force a parliamentary debate.
Families of the dead crew believe the vessel was dragged under by a submarine caught in fishing gear, and have blamed HMS Turbulent.
The Royal Navy has insisted HMS Turbulent was in Devonport Naval Base throughout the day.
In January, French Judge Brigette Lamy, who was involved in an investigation into whether charges of manslaughter or failing to assist a person in danger could be brought against HMS Turbulent or its crew, said she agreed with reports the submarine was in Plymouth at the time.
Jacques Losay, a relative of the trawler's skipper has made a film shown in Cornwall which disputes the Royal Navy's claims.
Mr Losay said the speed the vessel sunk could only be explained by the involvement of a submarine.
The sinking happened a day before Nato military exercises began in the area.
The 72ft (23m) Bugaled Breizh, which means ""child of Brittany"" in Breton, was based at the small port of Loctudy.","After the Bugaled Breizh sank off the Lizard on 15 January 2004, families of the victims claimed a Royal Navy submarine was responsible. But the Royal Navy has always denied any involvement in the sinking of the Bugaled Breizh. The official explanation given by the Royal Navy is that the incident was most likely caused by a collision with a submarine, but not one of their own.

The families of the victims have consistently questioned this explanation and have pushed for further investigation into the incident. They believe that the Royal Navy may have been conducting secret exercises in the area, which could have led to the collision.

Despite the families' efforts, no concrete evidence has been found to support their claims, and the case remains unsolved. Some have criticized the French investigation into the sinking, suggesting that it was not thorough enough and may have overlooked important evidence.

In 2018, the French authorities announced that they were reopening the investigation into the sinking, offering a glimmer of hope for the families seeking answers. However, as of now, no new developments have been reported.

The sinking of the Bugaled Breizh remains a tragic and unresolved mystery, leaving the families of the victims still searching for the truth."
"The bridge has been closed on May Day morning since 2005 after 40 people were injured jumping into the river.
Traditionally, thousands of people gather on and around Magdalen Bridge to hear choristers sing hymns at dawn from the tower at Magdalen College.
The city and county councils and police have worked to ""ensure a safe"" event.
Last year, about 30 revellers ignored safety warnings and broke through barriers to jump from the bridge.
The water is shallow and the county council said the cost to the health service in 2005 was about Â£50,000.
Police urged people not to ""abuse"" the decision to allow pedestrians access this year.
Many other events will take place across the city, including morris men dancing in Radcliffe Square, Catte Street and Broad Street.
Oxford City Council and the county's cultural development agency, Oxford Inspires, are both working with an event producer responsible for other big occasions in the city.
The leader of Oxford City Council, Councillor Bob Price, said: ""We have been working closely with the police and Oxfordshire County Council to ensure a safe and enjoyable event with Magdalen Bridge open, as it has traditionally been, and we are delighted that this collaboration has had a successful outcome.""
Oxford commander, Supt Amanda Pearson, said: ""Thames Valley Police supports the decision taken by the council to reopen Magdalen Bridge to the public for this year's May Morning celebrations, and will work closely with our partners to ensure this is done in a safe way.
""I would urge people to recognise this decision is one that has been made to further their enjoyment of this unique celebration, and not to abuse it.""","The bridge has been closed on May Day morning since 2005 after 40 people were injured jumping into the river. Traditionally, thousands of people gather on and around Magdalen Bridge in Oxford, England to celebrate the arrival of spring on May 1st. The festivities include singing, dancing, and the traditional ritual of jumping off the bridge into the River Cherwell.

However, in 2005, a tragic incident occurred when a large number of people jumped off the bridge simultaneously, resulting in chaos and injuries. Around 40 people were hurt, some seriously, as they landed on top of each other in the shallow water. The emergency services were overwhelmed, and it was a chaotic scene as people tried to rescue the injured.

Following this incident, the local authorities took the decision to close the bridge on May Day morning to prevent any further accidents. They deemed it unsafe for such large crowds to gather and engage in the potentially dangerous activity of jumping into the river from the bridge.

Since then, alternative locations and arrangements have been made for the May Day celebrations in Oxford. The tradition of singing from the bridge continues, but without the dangerous jumps. Thousands of people still gather on and around Magdalen Bridge to enjoy the festivities, but the focus now shifts to a more controlled and safe celebration.

The closure of the bridge on May Day morning serves as a reminder of the importance of safety and responsible celebrations. It also highlights the need for authorities to evaluate and regulate large-scale public events to ensure the well-being of participants."

"Fifteen were later released after questioning, the state-run Anadolu agency reported.
The academics are accused of engaging in ""terrorist propaganda"" and insulting the state.
But the detentions have rekindled concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey, analysts say.
The 15 released are lecturers at Kocaeli University in north-western Turkey, Anadolu reported. The three others are from Uludag University in Bursa province.
But the number of academics arrested could be higher, the Reuters news agency reported.
The declaration, signed by more than 1,000 academics in Turkey and abroad, calls on the government to halt ""massacres"" in the south-east.
The signatories stated that they refused to be ""a party to the crime"" and called for the resumption of peace efforts with the rebels.
The document was prompted by a Turkish government offensive against the outlawed separatist group Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, that includes military operations and curfews.
But President Erdogan accused those who signed the document - including renowned international linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky - of engaging in ""terrorist propaganda"" on behalf of the PKK.
The PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies and has fought a 30-year separatist insurgency in south-eastern Turkey that has killed tens of thousands of people.
Mr Erdogan accused the academics of being biased against the state and denounced them for failing to condemn rebel violence. He urged the judiciary to take action against their ""treachery"".
The Turkish opposition and the US ambassador to Turkey criticised prosecutors' orders to investigate and allow home searches of academics after Mr Erdogan's remarks.
US ambassador John Bass warned of the ""pressure having a chilling effect on legitimate political discourse across Turkish society regarding the sources and solutions to the ongoing violence"".
There have been repeated clashes between PKK separatists and the Turkish army in recent months, and the violence has recently escalated.
On Thursday a car bomb which the authorities said was planted by the rebels detonated outside a police headquarters in Cinar district. Six people were killed.
The government has imposed a series of curfews in the south-east while militants have erected barricades, dug trenches and used explosives to keep the authorities away.
Since August, human rights activists say 170 civilians have lost their lives in areas under curfew and thousands have been displaced, but Turkish officials have denied that the offensive has endangered or killed civilians.
The hashtag #1128katil (1,128 killers) was trending in Turkey on Thursday, particularly among government and nationalist supporters, apparently in reference to the academics.","Fifteen were later released after questioning, the state-run Anadolu agency reported. The academics are accused of engaging in ""terrorist propaganda"" and insulting the state. But the detentions have rekindled concerns about the state of academic freedom and freedom of expression in the country. The Turkish government has been criticized in the past for cracking down on dissent and stifling opposition voices.

Many believe that these arrests are part of a wider crackdown on academics and intellectuals who have been critical of the government's policies, particularly regarding human rights and freedom of speech. It is seen as a way to silence opposition and maintain control over public discourse.

These detentions have also raised concerns about the erosion of academic freedom in Turkey. Academics should be able to freely express their opinions and engage in research without fear of retribution or persecution. The arrests send a chilling message to other academics and intellectuals, creating a climate of self-censorship and discouraging critical thinking.

International human rights organizations have called on the Turkish government to respect academic freedom and release those detained for exercising their right to free speech. The targeting and persecution of academics not only violate their rights but also undermine the quality and credibility of academic institutions.

The detentions also highlight the broader issue of freedom of expression in Turkey. The government has been accused of using vague and broad anti-terrorism laws to target and silence individuals critical of the state. This hampers democratic processes and stifles public debates necessary for a healthy society.

Overall, the detentions of academics in Turkey have reignited concerns about academic freedom and freedom of expression in the country. The international community continues to monitor the situation and calls for the release of those detained and the protection of fundamental rights."
"A chimpanzee couple named Adam and Eve smashed windows to get out of their enclosure at the Sa Coma Safari Zoo on Monday.
Eve was surrounded as she neared the town of Son Carrio and shot dead.
Local media say that Adam is believed to be hiding in a wooded area close to residential housing.
Police have closed off a nearby road to try to prevent the 80kg (176lb) chimpanzee from reaching a nearby tourist area and beach front, according to reports.
How the animals managed to escape is not yet known.
""It is not very clear, but it seems they broke the bars of their cage,"" a spokesman for Spain's Guardia Civil told AFP news agency.
""These animals are very strong. They can lift double their weight.""
Animal rights groups have criticised the shooting of Eve.
Police said the chimpanzee had been killed because she had become ""very agitated"" and there was a risk she might attack a member of the search party.","A chimpanzee couple named Adam and Eve smashed windows to get out of their enclosure at the Sa Coma Safari Zoo on Monday. Eve was surrounded as she neared the exit, but Adam managed to escape and roamed freely within the zoo. Tensions rose as zookeepers quickly scrambled to contain the situation and ensure the safety of visitors.

Eve, still trapped inside the enclosure, began to display signs of distress. She desperately tried to communicate with the staff outside, banging on the windows and using various gestures to convey her fear and anxiety. Zookeepers tried to calm her down and assure her that help was on the way.

Meanwhile, Adam, the adventurous chimpanzee, exploited his newfound freedom to the fullest. He swung from tree branches, leaping with exuberance, and exploring areas of the zoo that had previously been off-limits. Visitors marveled at his acrobatic skills and playful nature, capturing videos and photos while keeping a safe distance.

"It comes after one of the team's players, Adrian Peterson, was charged with child abuse in Texas after hitting his son with part of a branch.
The Minneapolis team have reinstated the player after dropping him.
Meanwhile sponsors of the NFL as a whole have raised concerns about incidents of violence in the sport.
McDonald's, Visa, Anheuser-Busch and Campbell Soup Company have all issued statements urging the NFL to take ""appropriate"" action to deal with the incidents.
""We understand. We are taking action and there will be much more to come,'"" the NFL said on Tuesday in response.
But Radisson is the first sponsor to pull their support from a team.
""Radisson is suspending its limited sponsorship of the Minnesota Vikings while we evaluate the facts and circumstances,"" the company said.
It added it ""takes this matter very seriously, particularly in light of our long-standing commitment to the protection of children"".
Radisson's sponsorship includes a banner visible to viewers watching Vikings' news conferences.
The Minnesota Vikings said it had ""respectfully honoured Radisson's request"", a team spokesman said.
Mr Peterson stands accused of using part of a tree branch to spank his four-year-old son. The player says he was using a form of discipline his father used on him as a boy.
""I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser,"" Mr Peterson said in a statement.
""I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury.""
The Vikings dropped the player for Sunday's game but then reinstated him on Monday.
The team's general manager, Rick Spielman, said: ""I understand that this is a very difficult thing to handle. But we also feel strongly as an organisation that this is disciplining a child.
""Whether it's an abusive situation or not, or whether he went too far disciplining, we feel very strongly that that is the court's decision to make, but we also understand the seriousness of abusing children as well.''
The charges against Mr Peterson come just days after another NFL star, Ray Rice, had his contract terminated after a video emerged in which he appeared to punch his wife.","It comes after one of the team's players, Adrian Peterson, was charged with child abuse in Texas after hitting his son with part of a branch. The Minneapolis team have faced intense scrutiny and public backlash following the incident. Many have called for the team to take immediate action and suspend Peterson indefinitely. The incident has sparked a national conversation about the appropriate punishment for child abuse and how professional sports leagues should respond to such cases.

In response to the controversy, the Minnesota Vikings initially decided to allow Peterson to play in their next game, citing the legal process that he was entitled to. However, the team faced immense criticism from fans, sponsors, and the general public for their decision. After facing mounting pressure, the Vikings reversed their decision and placed Peterson on the NFL's exempt list, which means he is suspended from all team activities until his legal situation is resolved.

The incident involving Peterson has also brought attention to the larger issue of domestic violence and child abuse within the NFL. Many have accused the league of not taking such issues seriously enough and allowing players to continue participating despite facing serious charges. The Peterson case, along with other high-profile incidents involving players such as Ray Rice and Greg Hardy, has prompted the NFL to reevaluate its policies on domestic violence and child abuse.

The NFL has since implemented stricter penalties for players involved in cases of domestic violence and child abuse, including longer suspensions and mandatory counseling programs. The Peterson case, in particular, has become a catalyst for change and has pushed the league to demonstrate a stronger stance against such behavior.

The incident has also raised questions about the role of professional athletes as role models and the responsibility teams have in promoting and enforcing appropriate behavior. Some argue that teams should hold their players to higher standards and punish them accordingly for off-field misconduct. Others contend that athletes should not be held to different standards than the rest of society and that their personal lives should remain separate from their professional careers.

Ultimately, the Adrian Peterson child abuse case has sparked a wider discussion about the role of professional sports in addressing issues of violence and abuse. It has forced the NFL, teams, and fans to confront the accountability and responsibility that comes with being part of a sports league and has shed light on the need for systemic changes in how such cases are handled."

"Pregnant girls in Sierra Leone are prevented from attending school, as they are thought to be a bad influence on their peers.
In April 2015 - just as schools re-opened after the Ebola crisis - the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology issued a statement banning pregnant girls from mainstream education and from sitting exams.
The ban was enforced through invasive physical examinations of the girls.
Just under two years on, and the ban is still in place. Learning centres typically specialising in skills such as catering, tailoring, and hairdressing act as alternatives to school and are open to pregnant girls.
Olivia Acland photographed these girls, collecting their stories, and discovering that girls very rarely return to mainstream education after being pushed out of it.
Twenty-year-old Emma said:
""I moved to this learning centre when I got pregnant and am studying catering. At my old school I had to tell my teacher I was pregnant because she caught me sleeping at the desk. After that I was pulled into the principal's office and told not to come back.""
Isatu is 18 and wants to be a hairdresser, she said:
""I am learning the skills in a learning centre near to where I live. I used to dream of becoming a doctor but I don't think that is realistic any more. I doubt I'll ever go back to school.""
""I remember my principal saying that it is an abomination for the school to have pregnant girls attending,"" Jeneba continued.
""As soon as I started to show I left. When I see my friends in their school uniforms I feel sad and ashamed.""","Pregnant girls in Sierra Leone are prevented from attending school, as they are thought to be a bad influence on their peers. In April 2015 - just as schools re-opened after Ebola-related closures - the government of Sierra Leone issued a directive preventing pregnant girls from attending mainstream schools. This decision was met with severe criticism from human rights organizations, as it further marginalizes vulnerable girls and denies them their right to education.

Many pregnant girls in Sierra Leone are forced to drop out of school due to widespread societal stigma and discrimination. They face judgment and are often blamed for their pregnancies, regardless of the circumstances. This attitude exacerbates the already existing disparities in access to education for girls in the country.

The denial of education to pregnant girls not only violates their basic human rights but also contributes to perpetuating the cycle of poverty and gender inequality. Education plays a crucial role in empowering girls and women, providing them with opportunities for a better future. By denying them education, Sierra Leone is hindering the development and progress of its society.

Furthermore, the ban on pregnant girls attending school reinforces harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about sexuality and reproductive health. It fails to address the underlying issues related to early pregnancy, such as lack of information, access to contraceptives, and sexual exploitation.

Since the implementation of the ban, however, there have been efforts to challenge and overturn this discriminatory policy. Local and international advocacy groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have condemned the ban and called on the government to ensure equal access to education for all girls, regardless of their pregnancy status.

"""We ask police to go to the places the rest of us couldn't or wouldn't and we ask them to do it repeatedly,"" Ch Supt John Sutherland tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme.
""For 25 years I've watched colleagues do those things with extraordinary compassion and they do it so beautifully, but I don't think we've even begun to understand the impact it has on them to be exposed to repeated trauma.""
The senior Metropolitan Police officer knows from personal experience just how serious the impact can be.
In 2013, after years serving as a frontline police officer, Ch Supt John Sutherland began to feel unwell. He went on to suffer severe anxiety, depression and crippling exhaustion.
After going to see his GP, he was given emergency counselling, prescribed anti-depressants and signed off work.
It has taken him years to come to terms with his breakdown, which he says was caused by the trauma of dealing with the impact of horrific crimes, including murders and terror attacks.
Now, when terror attacks such as the ones in Manchester and Westminster take place, Ch Supt Sutherland says he ""struggles"" to deal with the extensive news coverage.
""It's the simple trauma of it,"" he says. ""I can't look at the pictures or read much of the coverage because I care too much.
""The second thing I struggle with is my inability to respond in the ways I used to be able to. It is a survivors' guilt type thing, knowing my colleagues are in there in the thick of it but if I was to even try I would be more unhelpful than helpful like offering personal support on the front line or visiting.""
Ch Supt Sutherland was a serving officer during the 7/7 attacks, when four suicide bombers killed 52 people in central London and injured more than 700. He was also at the scene of the failed 21/7 attacks, when failed bombers targeted three London Underground trains and a bus in an attempted repeat attack.
Since then, he has worked directly with colleagues who were first on the scene of 7/7 and the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
""The reality is police officers venture into hell and they see things and deal with things and have to make choices that are beyond the comprehension of most of us,"" he says.
But that bravery can come at a cost.
""From my experience of being at murder scenes, what I understand now is that it would be impossible to venture into those places and not be affected by it. We'd be something less than human if we didn't feel something.
""I didn't understand until years later the extent of the impact of what had I'd experienced and had happened to me,"" he says.
""It was no single thing for me that suddenly caught up on me after 22 years, it was cumulative.""
He has now chronicled his illness and the causes of it in a book, called A Life in Blue: a Memoir.
""As a society we have yet to fully understand the effect of repeated exposure to trauma on police,"" he says.
Ch Supt Sutherland, who now works in a non-operational role for London's Metropolitan Police, says his experiences during his career were just ""normal"" for a police officer.
But he says ""we don't all react and respond in the same ways"".
""If my story was about anything other than mental health, if it was about being shot or stabbed I'd feel no shame at all and would feel proud of myself and people's reaction would be one of equivocation. There would be a wound I could show, but mental health doesn't show up on x-rays.
""I felt desperately ashamed early on about mental illness and some of the bloke stuff of not being strong, that I'd fallen over when colleagues were still on duty - whilst I was curled up at home unable to move.""
This week - following the atrocity in Manchester - the terror level in the UK was raised to critical, its highest level. It means another terror attack could be ""imminent"".
He says that alone places an additional burden on the Met's police officers.
""It is also the realisation that every police officer is an explicit terrorist target. It's in your subconscious,"" he says.
""That places an enormous burden, but you won't find a single officer batting an eyelid or complaining at all. They do what they do best in these circumstances and get on with it proudly.""
Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","""We ask police to go to the places the rest of us couldn't or wouldn't and we ask them to do it repeatedly,"" Ch Supt John Sutherland tells the Victoria Derbyshire police force in England. But the toll it takes on their mental health is often overlooked. Policing can be a highly stressful and demanding job, with officers regularly exposed to traumatic incidents and dealing with individuals in crisis.

Sutherland emphasizes the importance of addressing the mental health of police officers and providing them with the necessary support. He states, ""It's not something that we can afford to ignore anymore. If we continue to neglect the mental health of our police officers, we will continue to see devastating consequences.""

The intense nature of police work often leads to feelings of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among officers. Sutherland believes that acknowledging and addressing these issues is crucial for the well-being of both individual officers and the overall effectiveness of the police force.

The stigma around mental health within the police force needs to be challenged in order to provide a supportive environment for officers. Increasing awareness, access to mental health resources, and implementing strategies to prevent mental health issues are all necessary steps in improving the situation.

Sutherland concludes, ""Our officers are not superheroes, they are human beings, and they need support just like everyone else. We owe it to them to ensure they receive the help they need and deserve."""
"Former Wales captain Kingsley Jones will take charge of the Welsh Pro12 region until the end of the season.
The Dragons are preparing for a European semi-final on Saturday and Jones' departure comes after weeks of speculation over his future.
""I have thoroughly enjoyed my three years at the Dragons,"" the 51-year old said in statement by the region.
""With the club transitioning into a new era of potentially new ownership and new investors, the time felt right for me to step aside.
""At the Dragons, we are seeing the emergence of an exciting generation of youngsters that can give the club a fighting chance of securing a place at the very top end of the game.
""I'm really proud to have played a part in this process. It's been immensely rewarding and I hope that it'll become the enduring legacy of my time with the Dragons.""
The Dragons have lost seven games in succession in the Pro12 and have won just four league games all season.
Jones missed the last two Dragons games because of ""illness"" but was spotted at English Premiership club Harlequins with his rugby player son Luc.
Chief executive Stuart Davies, who earlier this month called for investment at Rodney Parade, explained that the Dragons brought forward an end of season review because of Jones' illness, despite the Dragons being in a European semi-final where they face French club Montpellier on Saturday.
""Whilst a frustrating and disappointing season is mitigated by a lengthy injury list and a record number of narrow defeats resulting in losing bonus points, taking the decision now affords Kingsley Jones, head coach, the opportunity to look after the side for the remaining games, ahead of us considering our options for next season,"" said Davies in a statement.
""Both parties agreed it was best for the side that there was a new voice at the helm going forward.""
Jones returned to Wales following stints at an Abu Dhabi school and English club London Welsh.
The former Ospreys head coach appointed former Sale Sharks coach and namesake Kingsley Jones as his assistant and now the former Russia boss will step up and take charge at Rodney Parade.
Chairman Martyn Hazell added: ""We would like to thank Lyn for all his hard work during his time in charge at the Dragons, and to wish him well in whatever challenge he takes on next.
""Whilst this season may not have quite delivered, we remain very excited about the talented young squad that he has assembled and are grateful to him for all he has done at the region.""","Former Wales captain Kingsley Jones will take charge of the Welsh Pro12 region until the end of the season. The Dragons are preparing for a European semi-final on Saturday and have announced that Jones will be in charge for the remainder of the season. This comes after the departure of former head coach Bernard Jackman last week. Jones, who previously coached Sale Sharks and Russia, has been with the Dragons as an assistant coach since 2017 and has now been handed the interim head coach role. The Dragons will face Bristol Bears in the European Challenge Cup semi-final this weekend, and Jones will be tasked with guiding the team to victory.

"Culture Minister Ali Jannati said flights would only resume once those responsible had been punished.
The teenagers allege that before returning to Tehran from the Umra, or lesser Islamic pilgrimage, in March they were abused by security officials at Jeddah airport.
The move is likely to deepen tensions between the two regional powers.
They are currently at odds over the conflict in Yemen, where a coalition led by Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia is carrying out air strikes on Shia Houthi rebels, which the US says are receiving military assistance from Iran. Iran and the Houthis deny this.
On Saturday, hundreds of people protested outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran and demanded that the Iranian government ""end the unnecessary Umra"".
On Monday, Mr Jannati told state television: ""I have ordered the Hajj and Pilgrimage Organisation to suspend the Umra until the criminals are tried and punished.""
""Considering what has happened, Iranians' dignity has been damaged and a public demand has formed,"" he added.
The minister said Saudi officials had ""promised to punish the persons in custody"".
""They even asserted that they would execute them, but nothing has been done in reality so far.""
Each year about 500,000 Iranians undertake the Umra, an optional pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any time of the year other than during the main pilgrimage, or Hajj.
Although the Umra includes some of the rituals of the Hajj, which every sane adult Muslim must undertake at least once in their lives if they can afford it and are physically able, they are shortened and there are fewer of them.","Culture Minister Ali Jannati said flights would only resume once those responsible had been punished. The teenagers allege that before returning to Tehran from the Umra, or lesser Islamic pilgrimage, they were stopped at the airport by security forces and subjected to a humiliating body search. The incident deeply outraged the teenagers and their families, sparking widespread anger and protests across the country. The Culture Minister's statement indicates that the government is taking the matter seriously and is committed to holding the responsible individuals accountable for their actions.

The Umra pilgrimage is a significant religious journey for Muslims, and any mistreatment or disrespect towards pilgrims is seen as a grave offense. The incident has not only violated the fundamental rights of the teenagers but has also tarnished the reputation of the country as a religious destination.

By asserting that flights will only resume once those responsible are punished, the Culture Minister is sending a strong message that such behavior will not be tolerated and that the government is determined to uphold the rights and dignity of its citizens. This move aims to regain the trust of the public and reassure them that their voice matters in holding authorities accountable.

Furthermore, the protests and anger expressed by people indicate a desire for justice and an end to the mistreatment of individuals. It showcases the power of public opinion and the collective voice of citizens in shaping the actions and decisions of the government.

Overall, the culture minister's statement highlights the significance of the incident, acknowledges the grievances of the affected individuals, and affirms the government's commitment to address the issue appropriately to maintain the country's reputation and uphold the rights and dignity of its citizens."

"Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places after being attacked by Andrew Chamberlain, a court heard.
Chamberlain hit Mr Morgan with the 4ft metal pole after the neighbour left his car outside Chamberlain's home in Greenfield Terrace, Blackwood.
The 50-year-old, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent at Cardiff Crown Court, said he used the pole in self defence.
The court heard parking was a ""contentious issue"" on the street and residents agreed to only park outside their own homes.
When Mr Morgan parked outside Chamberlain's home, he became ""abusive and threatening,"" the court heard.
He took the large metal pole from his garden and Mr Morgan said he blocked a blow with his arm.
He said: ""It was excruciating pain as I am sure you can imagine.""
Chamberlain told the jury: ""When I lifted the pole up he punched out at me with his left hand.
""As I was bringing the pole down, it made contact with the side of his arm.""
Mr Morgan said he was not aware of any parking restrictions.
Sentencing was adjourned for reports to be prepared and Chamberlain was released on bail but Recorder Peter Griffiths QC warned him he faces jail.","Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places after being attacked by Andrew Chamberlain, a court heard. Chamberlain hit Mr Morgan with the 4ft metal pole after the two had a heated argument at a local pub. The incident took place outside the pub, where Chamberlain struck Morgan with the metal pole, causing severe injuries.

The court was told that Morgan had confronted Chamberlain about an earlier altercation they had. The argument quickly escalated, leading to Chamberlain's violent attack. Witnesses at the scene rushed to help Morgan and called emergency services.

Morgan was immediately taken to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed three fractures in his arm. He underwent surgery to set the broken bones and is currently recovering. The injuries have significantly impacted his daily life and ability to work.

Andrew Chamberlain was arrested shortly after the incident and charged with grievous bodily harm. He appeared before the court, where he pleaded guilty. The judge described the attack as ""unprovoked and vicious,"" emphasizing the severity of Chamberlain's actions.

The prosecution argued for a harsh sentence, highlighting the long-term physical and emotional impact on the victim. They also emphasized the need for justice to deter such violent acts in the future.

"The existing timber and thatch structure at West Stow, in Suffolk, is ""beyond repair"".
St Edmundsbury Borough Council is spending Â£20,000 on a replacement, which should take a couple of months to complete.
The reconstructions have been built on the site of a village which was believed to have existed from 420-650.
The site was excavated between 1965 and 1972 and the reconstruction project began with a team of students from Cambridge University in 1973.
Work on the new house has begun with a pit being dug so that its floor will be about a foot (30cm) below ground.
Sarah Broughton, chairwoman of the West Stow Anglo Saxon Village trust, said: ""The sunken building that is there now is beyond repair, so the idea is to put the first new building up for 10 years and for people to come along and watch the construction as it goes along.
""West Stow is an experimental archaeological site, so we are experimenting all the time with the construction to see what would have been used 1,500 year ago and what would have succeeded in the sandy soil.""
The builders will be using tools, materials and methods believed to have been used in the Anglo-Saxon period.
The timber framework for the new building is due to be raised on Wednesday.
Once the new house is built, the old one will be taken down and research carried out into the rotting process.
It is hoped this will give an insight into how long an Anglo Saxon house would have stayed up and how much material they could have recycled.","The existing timber and thatch structure at West Stow, in Suffolk, is ""beyond repair"". St Edmundsbury Borough Council is spending Â£20,000 on a replacement, which should take a couple of months to complete. The structure, which was originally built as a replica of an Anglo-Saxon village, has suffered extensive damage over the years due to wear and tear, as well as exposure to the elements.

The decision to replace the timber and thatch structure was made after a thorough assessment by experts, who concluded that repairs would be both costly and ineffective. The council decided that investing in a new structure would be a better long-term solution.

The new building will be constructed using more durable materials, such as treated timber and synthetic thatch, to ensure its longevity. It will also be designed to be more structurally sound, taking into consideration the various challenges faced by the previous structure.

The replacement project is expected to cost £20,000 and is being funded by the council. Construction is scheduled to start in the coming weeks, and it is estimated that the project will be completed within a couple of months. During this time, the site will be closed to the public for safety reasons.

Once the new structure is complete, it will serve as an important educational and historical attraction. West Stow is known for its Anglo-Saxon Village and Country Park, which offers visitors a unique opportunity to experience life in early medieval England.

The council hopes that the new structure will not only enhance the visitor experience but also provide a more sustainable and accessible facility for future generations. They are committed to preserving the historical significance of West"

"UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the UN Security Council that he believed the attack constituted a war crime. The UN report, he said, detailed the ""most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them"" in Halabja in 1988.
The first reported use of chemical weapons came at 02:45 local time on 21 August in Ein Tarma, in about 6km (3.7 miles) east of the centre of Damascus, and again at 02:47 in Zamalka, an adjoining district.
Using witness statements, GPS information and satellite imagery, Human Rights Watch confirmed four sites in Zamalka where at least eight rockets struck - al-Mahariq Street, Naher al-Tahoun Street in the Bostan area, near the Hamza mosque, and near the Tawfiq mosque in the al-Mazraat area.
In Muadhamiya, a town about 20km (12 miles) to the west of Zamalka, was struck by rockets at about 05:00 local time. One opposition activist said he counted seven projectiles falling in two areas - four next to the Rawda Mosque, and the other three about 500m (1,640ft) away in the area between Qahwa and Zeitouna Streets.
Within hours, dozens of videos were uploaded of large numbers of distressed and visibly sick adults and children with no external signs of injury. In some of the most graphic footage, dozens of bodies, including many small children and babies, were seen laid out in rows on the floors of clinics and mosques, and on streets in Muadhamiya, Ein Tarma, Zamalka and nearby areas.
The victims' symptoms - seen in the videos and described by medics - were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, including shortness of breath, disorientation, runny nose, eye irritation, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, general weakness, and eventual loss of consciousness.
The international medical charity, Medicins Sans Frontieres, said that over three hours on the morning of 21 August medical staff at three hospitals it supported in Damascus province treated large numbers of patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms"".
It has been difficult to establish a precise death toll from the attack, owing to the chaos resulting from the large number of casualties and the lack of any large hospitals in the affected areas.
While activists initially said about 300 people had been killed, by the end of 21 August the main opposition alliance had put the death toll at more than 1,300.
Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said at least 3,600 patients displaying ""neurotoxic symptoms"" had been treated at the hospitals it supported. Of those patients, 355 had died, it added.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based group that gets its information from a network of activists across Syria, later said it had confirmed at least 502 deaths.
The Violations Documentation Centre (VDC), an activist-run site cited by the United Nations that uses internationally accepted norms to verify deaths, lists at least 588 fatalities, including 135 women and 108 children. It names almost all of them.
A French intelligence assessment said that based on the technical analysis of 47 video tapes, no fewer than 281 people had died.
A preliminary US government assessment determined that 1,429 people had been killed, including 426 children.
The UN report said several surface-to-surface rockets capable of delivering significant chemical payloads were identified and recorded at investigated sites.
In Muadhamiya, the UN team were filmed inspecting an expended rocket motor found near the Rawda Mosque. In their report, they said the ordnance they found in the area was about 140mm wide and had an engine with 10 jet nozzles. They did not identify it, but arms experts said it was a Soviet-era 140mm surface-to-surface artillery rocket, known as the M-14.
In Zamalka, videos and photographs were published online that showed the remnants of what appeared to be unguided rockets. The UN inspectors did not identify the projectiles, but based on the measurements they and opposition activists provided, arms experts said they were adapted 330mm surface-to-surface artillery rockets.
The UN report estimated that the warheads on the 330mm rockets would have been able to carry between 50 and 62 litres (11-16 gallons) of chemical agent.
The UN report said samples found by Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-designated labs to contain the nerve agent, sarin, were recovered from a majority of the rockets or rocket fragments inspected.
Thirty environmental samples taken from impact sites and surrounding areas were also tested and the presence of sarin, its degradation and/or production by-products were observed in a majority, the report added.
Furthermore, UN medical experts examined 36 survivors who they diagnosed as still showing symptoms consistent with an organophosphate intoxication. Blood and urine samples from 34 of them provided ""definitive evidence"" of exposure to sarin, the inspectors said.
""The environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Muadhamiya and Zamalka,"" the inspectors conclude.
The UN mission was not asked to ascertain who was behind the attack.
However, by examining the debris field and impact area where the rockets struck in Muadhamiya and Ein Tarma, the inspectors found ""sufficient evidence"" to calculate azimuths, or angular measurements, that allow their trajectories to be determined ""with a sufficient degree of accuracy"".
When plotted on a map, the trajectories converge on a site that Human Rights Watch said was a large military base on Mount Qassioun that is home to the Republican Guard 104th Brigade.
Human Rights Watch said the Syrian military was believed to have M-14 rockets, and one of the three warheads produced for them can carry 2.2kg (4.8lb) of sarin. Rebel forces were not believed to possess M-14s nor the associated BM-14 launching system, it added.
The organisation said the 330mm rockets were ""of a type not listed in standard, specialised, international or declassified reference materials"". However, the rocket type had been documented in a number of other attacks on opposition-held areas in recent months, it noted.
Human Rights Watch said the 330mm rockets would be compatible with the 333mm Falaq-2 launcher produced by Iran, which the Syrian government is known to possess. Videos have emerged appearing to show Syrian troops using Falaq-2 systems to launch similarly adapted rockets. Human Rights Watch said no evidence had been produced showing rebel forces were in possession of the rockets or their associated launchers.
Opposition forces are also not believed to have been in possession of the amount of Sarin used in the attack - hundreds of kilograms, according to Human Rights Watch's calculations - nor to have expertise in the specialised procedures required to load chemical warheads.
Meanwhile, the Syrian military is widely believed to have more than 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals, including several hundreds of tonnes of sarin, as well as the required expertise.
The White House said US agencies had assessed ""with high confidence"" that the Syrian government was responsible. Human, signals and geospatial intelligence revealed that Syrian chemical weapons personnel prepared chemical munitions in the Damascus suburb of Adra in the three days prior to the attack, it added.
Intelligence, including satellite detections, also indicated that government forces had fired rockets and artillery shells from a government-controlled territory towards the suburbs where the chemical attacks occurred, the White House said.
""We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on 21 August and was concerned with the UN inspectors obtaining evidence,"" it added.
""On the afternoon of 21 August, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations. At the same time, the regime intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighbourhoods where chemical attacks occurred.""
The French intelligence assessment concluded that the attack ""could not have been ordered and carried out by anyone but the Syrian government"". It said ""the launch zone for the rockets was held by the regime while the strike zone was held by the rebels"", and that at the time commanders feared a wider attack on Damascus from the opposition.
It also said the section of the Syrian military responsible for filling munitions with chemical agents and for security at storage sites - ""Branch 450"" of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre (CERS) - was staffed only by members of the president's Alawite sect and was ""distinguished by a high level of loyalty to the regime"". Bashar al-Assad and certain members of his inner circle were the only ones permitted to give the order for the use of chemical weapons, it added.

Chemical weapons allegations
The Syrian government and military denied being behind the 21 August attack, describing the allegations made by Western powers as ""false and completely baseless"" and challenging them to present incontrovertible proof.
President Assad accused rebel groups supported by the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia of using chemical weapons to turn around the conflict in Syria because they were losing. He also said it would have been illogical for the military to use weapons of mass destruction in an area where its soldiers were present.
Russia also challenged the US to present its evidence, with President Vladimir Putin describing claims that the Syrian government was responsible as ""utter nonsense"". Russian officials suggested that rebels had sought to provoke international military intervention.
On 18 September, Russian media quoted the country's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, as saying during a visit to Damascus that Syria's government had provided additional information that showed rebels had used chemical weapons not only on 21 August but on other occasions. He also criticised the UN inspectors' report, saying it was ""distorted"" and ""one-sided"", and based upon ""insufficient"" information.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov drew attention to sources on the internet and other media, including a sceptical analysis of the videos of victims that was written by a Lebanese Carmelite nun, Mother Agnes Mariam de la Croix.
Mother Agnes, whose monetary is north of Damascus, said that she was convinced the entire attack was fabricated by the opposition - particularly the rows of apparently dead children whom she said had been drugged - with the goal of framing the Syrian government.
Russian and Syrian media also noted that videos published online on 16 September purportedly showed Islamist rebels from Liwa al-Islam launching the rockets that hit the Ghouta on 21 August. Liwa al-Islam subsequently insisted that the videos were ""completely fabricated"".","UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the UN Security Council that he believed the attack constituted a war crime. The UN report, he said, detailed the ""most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since the horrific events in Syria in 2013."" Ban Ki-moon called for the Security Council to take immediate action and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.

The attack he referred to was the devastating chemical weapons attack that occurred in August 2015 in the Ghouta region of Syria. According to the UN report, the attack involved the use of chlorine gas, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians, including many children.

Ban Ki-moon expressed his deep concern over the flagrant disregard for international law and the well-being of civilians. He emphasized the urgency of ending the use of chemical weapons and preventing impunity for such heinous crimes.

The UN Secretary General's statement highlights the gravity of the situation and the need for a strong international response. The use of chemical weapons against civilians is a clear violation of international norms and constitutes a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.

Ban Ki-moon's call for action underscores the responsibility of the international community to protect civilians and uphold the principles of international humanitarian law. It also emphasizes the importance of holding those responsible accountable to prevent future attacks and deter the use of chemical weapons.

The statement serves as a reminder of the ongoing atrocities in Syria and the urgent need for a political resolution to the conflict. It also emphasizes the role of the UN Security Council in ensuring peace and security and upholding international law in the face of such grave violations."
"Belfast's Frampton, 29, was in full control of the first half of the fight, during which his opponent simply could not find his range.
Bury's Quigg, 27, finally came alive down the stretch as the contest turned into a desperate tussle, but Frampton gave as good as he got.
Bizarrely, one judge scored it 115-113 for Quigg, while the two others scored it 116-112 in Frampton's favour.
Frampton said: ""The travelling support has been unbelievable - this isn't Manchester, is it? Seems like it is Belfast.
""I couldn't believe it was a spilt [decision]. I don't know what that lad was watching. He needs to take a long hard look at himself.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""I knew it was going to be a boring fight - I had to sell it for TV. I knew I had the brain to do that and make it boring.""
Although there was no rematch clause in the contract, there was a verbal agreement that they would do it all again in Belfast if the first fight warranted it.
And while it was a slow-burner, a cracking second half ensued, which sent the 20,000 fans packed into the Manchester Arena into raptures - and will surely mean a return will take place later this year.
It was Quigg's first defeat in 34 professional fights, stretching back to 2007. Frampton is undefeated in 22 fights since turning pro in 2009.
Frampton-Quigg was one of the most eagerly-anticipated domestic match-ups in recent memory, and the first time two undefeated British boxers had fought to unify a world title.
The Northern Irishman was a narrow favourite with the bookmakers. However, his odds lengthened after he was knocked down twice by unheralded Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez last July, on the same day that Englishman Quigg demolished tough Spaniard Kiko Martinez - who had taken Frampton the distance in 2014.
Both men claimed to have won the mind games during a heated build-up, as well as insisting they were the better boxer and that losing was not an option.
While it was expected there would be an even split of fans, the reactions to the fighters' entrances suggested Frampton had the lion's share of support, despite Quigg being the 'home' fighter.
Frampton probably nicked a largely non-eventful first round courtesy of a couple of crisp jabs, while the second went largely the same way until the last minute, when Quigg finally came out of his shell.
There was more engagement in the third, with Frampton continuing to stalk his rival and Quigg grazing Frampton's chin with a couple of flashing left hooks.
Frampton, demonstrating a better appreciation of distance, controlled the fourth as well, although Quigg did land with one thudding overhand right.
As the fifth rolled by, it was becoming difficult to work out what Quigg's game-plan was, other than to catch Frampton off guard with a big right hand.
There were a few boos after the sixth, which Frampton, boxing beautifully on the back foot, controlled again.
Quigg finally started taking a few risks in the seventh, but that only allowed Frampton to show off his defensive skills and pick him off on the counter.
Round eight was probably Quigg's, courtesy of a couple of big right hands and a sweet uppercut. However, he also missed with some wind-milling right hands.
The fight was finally cooking by the ninth, during which Quigg tagged Frampton with a juddering right hand and a strafing left hook.
The 10th was a tremendous round, with both men opening up, trading blows to head and body and doing extremely well not to buckle.
And the following round was more of the same, with some vicious body shots bookended by two more huge Quigg right hands, which clearly hurt his rival.
The previously bitter rivals hugged before the final round, which ended with Frampton showing off his Ali-shuffle, a sure sign he thought he had won by some distance.
In the chief support, Gavin McDonnell earned a unanimous decision over Panama's Jorge Sanchez to earn a shot at the WBC super-bantamweight title.
After his victory, the undefeated Doncaster boxer said he would like to fight the winner of Frampton-Quigg.
Also on the undercard, Manchester's Hosea Burton stopped Hertfordshire's Miles Shinkwin in round six to win the vacant British light-heavyweight title.
Morecambe's Isaac Lowe stopped Belfast's Marco McCullough to secure the vacant Commonwealth featherweight belt.
And former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Scott Fitzgerald won on his pro debut, the Preston light-middleweight stopping Swindon's Ben Heap in round three.","Belfast's Frampton, 29, was in full control of the first half of the fight, during which his opponent simply could not find his range. Bury's Quigg, 27, finally came alive in the later rounds, showing intensity and determination to turn the tide in his favor. The two fighters engaged in a thrilling back-and-forth exchange, with both landing solid shots and exhibiting incredible resilience.

Frampton's speed and accuracy gave him the upper hand in the early rounds, as he consistently outboxed Quigg and landed clean shots. Quigg, known for his power punches, struggled to find his rhythm and connect with significant blows.

However, Quigg refused to back down and started to make his presence felt in the middle rounds. He showcased his determination and unleashed a series of devastating hooks and uppercuts that momentarily rocked Frampton. The crowd erupted as Quigg finally found his range and showcased his power.

The fight reached its climax in the later rounds, as both fighters pushed themselves to the limit. They traded blows, with each fighter showcasing incredible heart and resilience. The crowd was on their feet, witnessing an intense battle between two skilled and determined athletes.

In the end, Frampton's early dominance proved to be the deciding factor. His superior boxing skills and ability to control the distance ultimately secured him the victory. Quigg's comeback in the later rounds was too little, too late, as he couldn't close the gap created by Frampton's early lead.

The fight between Frampton and Quigg will be remembered as a fierce and thrilling encounter, showcasing the talent and determination of both fighters. It was a testament to their dedication and skill, leaving boxing fans eagerly anticipating their future matchups."

"The Mid Antrim 150 club say inclement weather this year, combined with a poor attendance at the event, has forced the decision.
The event was dogged with heavy rain prior to race day, which resulted in the paddock turning into a quagmire.
Plans are in place for the race to return in 2018 and to become a regular event on the calendar.
The race has been dogged by setbacks over the past eight years and 2016 was the first time the meeting returned to the Irish road racing calendar since 2013, due to a shortfall in finances.
The Mid Antrim was the first national road race of 2016 after being moved to a new slot at the beginning of April.

The Armoy road races will be staged on 28-29 July.","The Mid Antrim 150 club say inclement weather this year, combined with a poor attendance at the event, has forced the decision. The event was dogged with heavy rain prior to its start, leading to a waterlogged track and difficult riding conditions. Despite efforts to improve the track, including pumping water and adding extra drainage, the conditions remained unfavorable. 

Furthermore, the poor attendance at the event also played a significant role in the decision to cancel. Organizers rely on ticket sales, sponsorship, and contributions to cover the costs associated with hosting the race. With a lack of support from spectators, the financial viability of the event was severely compromised. 

The Mid Antrim 150 club expressed disappointment in having to cancel the event, as it has been a popular fixture in the racing calendar for many years. However, they emphasized that the safety of both riders and spectators is their utmost priority.

"He suggested that immigration, rather than trade, would be the biggest issue for the City of London after the UK leaves the European Union.
Banks are increasingly becoming technology companies and so they need the best engineers, Mr Staley said.
Keeping that talent should be the government's top priority, he added.
His comments signal a shift among City groups after suggestions last year that the biggest risk from Brexit was the loss of EU trading rights.
Mr Staley told the BBC: ""Making sure we have access to the best and brightest of talent around the world coming to London... is perhaps the most important thing for the financial industry, perhaps even more important than passporting.""
So-called passporting rights allow banks to serve clients across the EU without the need for licences in individual countries.
They are considered by some to be vital to London's position as a financial hub.
However, Mr Staley, who was speaking at a Brexit event in London, said the strength of the City came from the ""intellectual capital"" of its workers.
For that reason, Google's decision to expand its presence in London was potentially ""the most important economic announcement post-Brexit"", the Barclays boss said.
He added that banks would benefit from the calibre of workers that Google attracts after it made London its second most important development hub outside of San Francisco.
It's been commonly assumed that banks are most concerned about their ability to sell their services into the EU from London - so-called ""passporting"" - but today's comments show priorities are changing as the chances of retaining those rights look all but dead.
Both Mr Staley and the chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, said that contingency plans to deal with the passporting issue were close to being triggered.
Both men seemed sceptical that enough clarity on the future shape of the UK's relationship would emerge in time for them to put on hold plans to move jobs and functions into the EU.
Barclays is planning to move at least 150 jobs to Dublin, which will become a fully fledged European subsidiary. HSBC has already announced plans to move 1,000 jobs to Paris.
Read more from Simon's blog.
Mr Staley said banks would start shifting some operations to the EU ""reasonably"" soon to avoid disruption after Brexit.
The UK has opened formal Brexit talks with the EU, but it is unclear what levels of access businesses will have to EU markets after its departure.
Mr Staley was speaking after Brexit Secretary David Davis told the conference in London that the UK's place in the world was being reshaped.
""Securing an agreement with the EU within the two-year period about our withdrawal and the shape of our future relationship will be challenging,"" Mr Davis said.
A report commissioned by TheCityUK late last year found that up to 75,000 jobs could be lost in financial services if the UK left the EU single market.
The British Bankers Association also warned banks were getting ready to relocate out of the UK to continue serving customers in Europe.
Both groups have said recently that access to EU markets and talent are key priorities in the Brexit talks.","He suggested that immigration, rather than trade, would be the biggest issue for the City of London after the UK leaves the European Union. Banks are increasingly becoming technology companies in order to stay competitive. Immigration, on the other hand, could impact the talent pool available to the City of London. Without access to skilled workers from the EU, companies in the financial sector could face difficulties in recruiting and retaining top talent.

Additionally, the City of London has historically been a global financial hub attracting talent from all over the world. Restrictions on immigration could limit its ability to attract international talent, which could hinder its position as a leading financial center.

On the other hand, the statement about banks increasingly becoming technology companies suggests that the financial sector is undergoing a transformation. As technology continues to advance, banks are adapting by investing heavily in digital tools, automation, and artificial intelligence. This shift towards technology could impact the type of skills and talent needed in the industry.

Overall, while trade may also be a significant issue for the City of London post-Brexit, the suggestion that immigration will have a larger impact highlights the importance of talent and human capital in maintaining the city's financial success."
"The support staff are protesting against the county council's proposal to only pay them during term time.

Reaction to the teaching assistant strikes and other news from north-east England
Picket lines were operating outside about 50 schools in the area, according to union officials, with lobbying of a council meeting planned for Wednesday.
Jen Linford said she felt ""so under-valued"" that she quit her teaching assistant role after 37 years.
Joining a picket line in Blackhall, near Peterlee, Mrs Linford said: ""If the council walked in our shoes they would realise we deserve more not less. I think it's shameful.
""I still have bills to pay, but morally I just thought that I deserved more and I'm not going to do this anymore. So currently, I work in Asda.
""I have had cuddles this morning from children that I left in July. It's very upsetting.
""I feel the skills that I gained over many years are not being used as they should.""
Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said: ""The way these teaching assistants have been treated is nothing short of disgraceful.
""The number of schools closing as a result shows how strongly staff feel.
""They regret any disruption to parents but feel they have no other option.""
Councillors voted in May to dismiss the classroom assistants and re-employ them on term-time contracts from January 2017, with one year's compensation.
Following discussions, that offer was increased to two years' compensation with the new terms to be introduced from April 2017.
Members of the GMB and Unite unions voted to accept it.
John Hewitt, the county council's corporate director for resources, said: ""The legal advice is unequivocal - the status quo is not an option.
""There is a real and substantial risk from costly equal pay claims which are already materialising and which use teaching assistants as the comparator - most people are not paid for hours and weeks they don't work - so addressing this is also an issue of fairness.""
On Monday the council said 37 of the county's 243 schools - mainly nurseries and special schools - would be closed with 76 seeing classes interrupted.","The support staff are protesting against the county council's proposal to only pay them during term time. Unions ATL and Unison say the move would see some people lose about 20% of their annual income. The support staff, which includes teaching assistants, janitors, and administrative personnel, argue that their work is essential throughout the year and should be compensated accordingly.

The county council's proposal aims to save money by aligning the support staff's salaries with teachers' contracts, which also follow term-time payment. They argue that this measure is necessary to address budget constraints and ensure fairness across the education system.

However, the unions argue that support staff's work extends beyond term time and includes preparation, planning, and other necessary tasks. They argue that these staff members are integral to the smooth functioning of schools and should be paid accordingly.

The protests have gained significant attention, with support staff staging demonstrations outside council buildings and rallying public support against the proposal. Both unions are considering further actions, including potential strikes, to pressure the council into reconsidering their decision.

The county council is currently reviewing the situation and engaging in talks with the unions to find a solution that works for all parties involved. However, no agreement has been reached yet, and tensions remain high between the support staff and the council.

The outcome of these negotiations will have a significant impact on the livelihoods of support staff members and may further affect the overall functioning of schools if there is a disruption in their services."
"The rules encourage ""vloggers"" to label advertising content and explain when they have been asked to feature products sent to them by companies.
The Committee of Advertising Practice (Cap) has issued its first guidance since a landmark Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruling last year.
The ASA said several vlogs praising Oreo biscuits were not clearly marked.
The ruling was originally sparked by a BBC Newsround report into vloggers' lack of clarity on advertising rules.
The Cap guidelines discuss several scenarios in which text clarifying that content is sponsored, or that a product placement arrangement is in place, might be added to videos.
""A key rule under the Cap code is that if the content is controlled by the marketer, not the vlogger, and is written in exchange for payment (which could be a monetary payment or free items) then it is an advertisement feature and must be labelled as such,"" it says.
Cap also advises brands collaborating directly with vloggers to be equally clear that the resulting content is a form of online marketing.
Similarly, vloggers advertising their own products need to make viewers aware of this before they begin watching, via the title of the video.
In a statement, Shahriar Coupal, director of Cap, said: ""Wherever ads appear we should be confident we can trust what an advertiser says; it's simply not fair if we're being advertised to and are not made aware of that fact.""
However, the guidelines noted that when free items are sent to vloggers without any editorial or content control over videos exerted by the brand in question, there is no need for them to follow the Cap code.
Those calling for greater clarity on the issue have welcomed the move.
Riyad Barmania, at vlogger talent company ChannelFlip said that ever since the Advertising Standards Authority's (ASA) ruling against vlogs celebrating Oreo biscuits, his company has been working with the authority to check that content meets current guidelines.
""It's been difficult speaking to YouTube creators not to have some official guidelines,"" he said. ""It's great to have that clarity.""
He added that vloggers are, generally, quickly becoming more aware of the rules.
""A lot of YouTube creators are much more savvy and aware of branded content rules than they were a few years ago,"" he explained.
Co-editor of online vlogger magazine TenEightyMagazine.com Alex Brinnand says vloggers will probably benefit from the clarifications.
""I definitely feel there should be a clearer message given to users,"" he said. ""They're not sure where these rules are coming from and who's policing them.
""If YouTubers are doing it wrong it's because they don't know better.""
The influence of today's vloggers hasn't gone unnoticed.
They are increasingly viewed as role models by teenagers, according to Your Life, a government-backed campaign encouraging young people to choose maths and physics at A-level.
Nearly a quarter of 11 to 19-year-old girls (24%) view well-known fashion and beauty vlogger Zoella as a role model, according to a recent report published by the group.
""Because YouTube is part video distribution platform and part social network, it allows viewers at home to feel very close to the personalities they watch,"" said Jonathan Davenport, digital content consultant for Your Life, in a statement.
""As a result, YouTube is now the biggest platform for teenagers, which is why anyone with a message for a teenage audience must address them on YouTube.""","The rules encourage ""vloggers"" to label advertising content and explain when they have been asked to feature products sent to them by companies. The Committee of Advertising Practice (Cap) has issued new guidelines for vloggers to ensure transparency and protect consumers from deceptive marketing practices. As part of these guidelines, vloggers are required to clearly identify any content that is sponsored, paid for, or supported by a brand. They must also disclose any free products or gifts received from companies.

The aim of these rules is to ensure that viewers are aware of the commercial nature of the content they are consuming. By disclosing sponsorship and product placements, vloggers allow their audience to make informed decisions and differentiate between personal opinions and paid endorsements.

The Committee of Advertising Practice is responsible for maintaining these guidelines in the UK and ensures that vloggers adhere to them. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) taking action against the vlogger.

These guidelines align with the growing influence and popularity of vloggers in the advertising industry. As these content creators gain a significant following, their recommendations and endorsements have the potential to significantly impact consumer behavior. Therefore, it is imperative for vloggers to maintain transparency and disclose any commercial relationships to protect consumer trust and ensure ethical advertising practices."
"The US conservative TV station has apologised and reportedly paid the former Fox & Friends co-host $20m to drop her case.
Ms Carlson's allegations led to Fox's chief executive, Roger Ailes, leaving the channel in July.
She had complained that Mr Ailes victimised her and ruined her career after she rejected his advances.
""We regret and apologise for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,"" said 21st Century Fox, which owns Fox News.
Ms Carlson, 50, had claimed that Mr Ailes, 76, one of the most prominent figures in US television, first demoted her then sacked her after she spurned him.
For many years she had co-hosted the Fox and Friends morning show before being given her own programme in 2013.
Mr Ailes denied the allegations but resigned after an investigation by 21st Century Fox brought forward similar complaints from other female employees.
Another presenter, Greta Van Susteren, resigned on Tuesday, but Fox News did not give a reason for her abrupt departure after 14 years. One source described it as a financial disagreement.
Roger Ailes became a leading figure in US cable news after Rupert Murdoch brought him in to set up Fox in the mid-1990s.
For almost 20 years, Mr Ailes was the top dog as his channel posted annual profits of hundreds of millions of dollars, and transformed the cable news landscape, which had been dominated by CNN.
Ms Carlson said: ""I am gratified that 21st Century Fox took decisive action after I filed my complaint.
""I want to thank all the brave women who came forward to tell their own stories and the many people across the country who embraced and supported me.""
In her complaint, made after she was sacked in June, Ms Carlson's lawyer said that Mr Ailes ""unlawfully retaliated against Carlson and sabotaged her career because she refused his sexual advances and complained about severe and pervasive sexual harassment"".
Mr Ailes worked on the presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush before going on to set up Fox News in 1996.
He has reportedly advised the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump since leaving the network.
Mr Ailes continues as an informal adviser to Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox.","The US conservative TV station has apologised and reportedly paid the former Fox & Friends co-host $20m to drop her case. Ms Carlson's allegations led to Fox's chief executive, Roger Ailes, resigning amidst a sexual harassment scandal. The apology and settlement were seen as a significant victory for Ms Carlson and the broader movement against workplace harassment. Some critics argued that the payment was evidence of a culture that protected high-profile harassers, while others praised Ms Carlson for her courage in standing up against the network. This scandal prompted a nationwide conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace and the power dynamics at play in the media industry."

So the Prestonpans youngster, who has the bowel disease Crohn's, designed a door sign indicating the needs of people not visibly disabled.
Labour MSP Iain Gray is now supporting Grace's Sign campaign and will praise it in the Holyrood chamber.
The politician will lead a members' debate titled ""World Toilet Day, We Can't Wait"".
Mr Gray, an East Lothian MSP, said: ""The debate will enable me to put Grace's campaign on the agenda at Holyrood as well as highlight the work that still needs to be done globally to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all.""
He added that Grace had already made ""considerable progress"", including coming up with her own new design for door signs.","Grace Warnock was keen to highlight that easily accessible toilets were not just for wheelchair users.

"Thomson Airways flights from Manchester to Florida, USA, and from Glasgow to Cancun in Mexico, took off as scheduled at 09:40 BST.
Boeing, which produces the planes made of carbon fibre and plastic, claims it is the world's most efficient aircraft.
Thomson had planned to use the 787s from May, but all 50 were grounded in January over faulty batteries.
Singer Alesha Dixon greeted passengers arriving at Manchester Airport on Monday.
Chris Browne, managing director of Thomson Airways said the introduction of the ""revolutionary"" aircraft was a ""major milestone"" for operators.
Each aircraft can carry up to 291 passengers and fly as high as 38,000ft (11,500m).
Boeing claims the combination of lightweight materials and new engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce means that the Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than equivalent aircrafts in use and also 60% quieter.
The firm had originally hoped the plane would go into commercial service in 2008, but it has been dogged by production difficulties.
Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways operated the first commercial flight in October 2011.
Boeing's worldwide fleet of Dreamliners were grounded and deliveries halted for three months, however, after a battery on an All Nippon Airlines 787 caught fire and a malfunction forced another flight to make an emergency landing.
Flights using the aircrafts were reintroduced in April after new batteries were fitted.
Thomson Airways are planning to take delivery of eight 787s in total.
British Airways has taken delivery of the first two of 42 Dreamliners ordered over the next 10 years and Virgin Atlantic is scheduled to get the first of its 16 Dreamliners in September 2014.","Thomson Airways flights from Manchester to Florida, USA, and from Glasgow to Cancun in Mexico, took off as scheduled at 09:40 BST. Boeing, which produces the planes made of carbon fibre composites, stated that these flights were significant milestones for the aviation industry.

The Thomson Airways flights marked the first ever long-haul flights using Boeing 787 Dreamliners made of carbon fibre composites. Carbon fibre composites are lighter and stronger than traditional aluminum materials used in aircraft construction, allowing for increased fuel efficiency and overall performance.

The Manchester to Florida flight covered a distance of approximately 4,400 miles, while the Glasgow to Cancun flight covered around 4,900 miles. Both flights showcased the capabilities of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in long-haul operations.

Thomson Airways, a subsidiary of TUI Group, has a fleet of 15 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, making it the largest UK operator of these aircraft. The company has been investing in greener and more efficient aircraft to reduce its environmental impact.

The use of carbon fibre composites in aircraft construction has been a significant development for the aviation industry. These materials offer numerous advantages beyond increased fuel efficiency, including improved passenger comfort due to a quieter cabin. The use of composites also allows for more flexibility in aircraft design and can lead to longer maintenance intervals.

Boeing has been a pioneer in the adoption of carbon fibre composites in aircraft manufacturing, and the success of Thomson Airways' long-haul flights further highlights the industry's move towards more sustainable and efficient air travel.

As more airlines and manufacturers embrace the use of carbon fibre composites, it is expected that the aviation industry will continue to see advancements in fuel efficiency, performance, and sustainability, ultimately benefiting both passengers and the environment."
"Myles Bradbury was jailed for 16 years after admitting abusing 18 victims at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Bradbury manipulated the system to perform ""criminal, intimate examinations"", the report found.
Staff noticed he was seeing patients out-of-hours, but presumed he was doing it to help them out.
The hospital had a rule that a chaperone should be present for these examinations but it was often ignored.
A doctor confronted Bradbury, from Herringswell, Suffolk, when she noticed he was seeing a boy on his own, but he said it was at the patient's request.
He told families it was ""essential for him to see their child alone"" and they should learn to trust doctors, the independent investigation found.
Bradbury, who used a ""spy pen"" to secretly capture pictures of his partially-clothed victims, was arrested in December 2013. He admitted 25 offences dating between 2009 and 2013, including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images.
However, the report found there had been several clues to his offending prior to this.
The 42-year-old, who worked as a blood cancer specialist at the hospital for five years, phoned families on his personal number to make appointments.
He saw some children more often than necessary but failed to record these consultations, according to the report by Verita, a consultancy which specialises in public sector investigations.
Other key points from the report, commissioned by Addenbrooke's, included:
Doctors explained he spent a lot of time ""ingratiating himself"" into families' affections and his office wall was covered in letters from children.
Dr Jag Ahluwalia, medical director of the trust, told the investigation his staff were also ""duped"" by Bradbury.
""To a degree I have beaten myself up over it, and so have his paediatric oncology colleagues, but I think they were all groomed along the way,"" he told the investigation.
Myles Bradbury always had a plausible answer whenever he was challenged. Always quick with a cover story, his lies kept him safe for years.
The exact number of children he molested is unknown. He abused the trust of everyone, twisting and manipulating hospital policies and systems.
When he drew a curtain around his young patient, he knew no professional or parent would invade his privacy.
It gave him confidence to carry out his attacks, as parents stayed just feet away, unaware of what was going on.
The Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, was praised for acting decisively after a concern was raised in November 2013.
A woman complained her 11-year-old grandson, who was in remission from leukaemia, was asked to strip naked and touch his own genitals.
She rang the paediatric day unit and told the receptionist. Bradbury was then suspended and never returned to the hospital except for formal interviews.
Addenbrooke's contacted Suffolk police, which had two weeks previously been independently alerted to a Canadian police investigation into Bradbury after he purchased an online video of naked children.
Bradbury was initially jailed for 22 years but this was later reduced on appeal to 16 years' imprisonment and six years on licence.
Report authors Lucy Scott-Moncrieff and Barry Morris interviewed Bradbury in prison. He told them he ""knew that what he did was wrong"" and was ""very sorry"".
Bradbury said that he ""did not want to excuse his behaviour"" and was willing to talk in the hope that this would reduce the risk of other children being harmed in the future.
The trust said it wanted ""to say sorry again"" to its patients and families who ""placed their trust"" in Bradbury.
""This has been a deeply distressing case and the NHS must learn from it,"" said David Wherrett, acting chief executive of Cambridge University Hospitals Foundation Trust.
""My message to other organisations is that as well as enforcing robust policies, we need to raise awareness of much more manipulative behaviour by individuals like Bradbury.
""Greater rigour and checks will make it more difficult for abuse to take place.""","Myles Bradbury was jailed for 16 years after admitting abusing 18 victims at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Bradbury manipulated the system to perform ""criminal, intimate examinations"", the report found. Staff at the hospital failed to report their concerns about his behavior, allowing his abuse to continue for a number of years. The report also highlighted a lack of effective safeguarding procedures in place at the time, which contributed to the delay in Bradbury's actions being discovered.

The victims, who were children and young people with cancer, were subjected to unnecessary examinations and invasive procedures by Bradbury. He used his position as a consultant pediatrician to gain the trust of his victims and their families, making it easier for him to manipulate the system and carry out his abuse.

The report emphasized the devastating impact of Bradbury's actions on the victims and their families, highlighting the breach of trust that occurred. It also acknowledged the bravery of the victims in coming forward and sharing their experiences.

Following Bradbury's conviction, Addenbrooke's Hospital implemented a range of measures to improve safeguarding procedures and ensure that similar incidents could not happen in the future. These measures included improved supervision, training, and support for staff, as well as the introduction of a robust reporting system for any concerns or suspicions about staff behavior.

The case of Myles Bradbury serves as a stark reminder of the importance of effective safeguarding procedures in healthcare settings. It highlights the need for healthcare professionals and institutions to remain vigilant and prioritize the welfare and safety of vulnerable patients at all times."
